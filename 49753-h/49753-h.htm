your Sanction——that the Composition
of it has stood the Test of
your Judgment——and that it is by

  <h2 class='c005'>AN<br /> <br />ADDRESS<br /> <br />TO THE<br /> <br />PUBLIC.<br /> <br />THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_7 c006'><i>The favourable reception this Work
has met with, claims the Author’s most
grateful acknowledgments. A large edition
having run off in a few months, and the sale
appearing to be still unabated, a new impression
is become necessary. On this occasion
was he to conceal his feelings, and
pass over, in silence, a distinction so beneficial
and flattering, he would justly incur
the imputation of ingratitude. That he
might not do this, he takes the opportunity,
which now presents itself, of conveying to
the Public (though in terms inadequate to
the warm emotions of his heart) the sense
he entertains of their favour; and thus transmits
to them his thanks.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>In this new edition, care has been taken
to rectify those errors which have unavoidably
proceeded from the hurry of the press,
and likewise any incorrectness in the language
that has found its way into it.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>The credibility of some of the incidents
related in the following pages, and some
of the stories introduced therein, having
been questioned, particularly the prognostication
of the Indian priest on the banks of
Lake Superior, and the story of the Indian
and his rattle snake, the author thinks it
necessary to avail himself of the same opportunity,
to endeavour to eradicate any impressions
that might have been made on the
minds of his readers, by the apparent improbability
of these relations.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>As to the former, he has related it just
as it happened. Being an eye-witness to
the whole transaction (and, he flatters himself,
at the time, free from every trace of
sceptical obstinacy or enthusiastic credulity)
he was consequently able to describe every
circumstance minutely and impartially. This
he has done; but without endeavouring to
account for the means by which it was accomplished.
Whether the prediction was
the result of prior observations, from which
certain consequences were expected to follow
by the sagacious priest, and the completion
of it merely accidental; or whether he was
really endowed with supernatural powers,
the narrator left to the judgment of his
readers; whose conclusions, he supposes, varied
according as the mental faculties of
each were disposed to admit or reject facts
that cannot be accounted for by natural
causes.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>The story of the rattle snake was related
to him by a French gentleman of undoubted
veracity; and were the readers of this
work as thoroughly acquainted with the sagacity
and instinctive proceedings of that
animal, as he is, they would be as well assured
of the truth of it. It is well known,
that those snakes which have survived
through the summer the accidents reptiles
are liable to, periodically retire to the
woods, at the approach of winter; where
each (as curious observers have remarked)
takes possession of the cavity it had occupied
the preceding year. As soon as the season
is propitious, enlivened by the invigorating
rays of the sun, they leave these retreats,
and make their way to the same spot, though
ever so distant, on which they before had
found subsistence, and the means of propagating
their species. Does it then require any extraordinary
exertions of the mind to believe,
that one of these regular creatures, after
having been kindly treated by its master,
should return to the box, in which it had
usually been supplied with food, and had
met with a comfortable abode, and that nearly
about the time the Indian, from former experiments,
was able to guess at? It certainly
does not; nor will the liberal and ingenuous
doubt the truth of a story so well
authenticated, because the circumstances appear
extraordinary in a country where the
subject of it is scarcely known.</i></p>

<p class='c000'><i>These explanations the author hopes will
suffice to convince his readers, that he has
not, as travellers are sometimes supposed to
do, amused them with improbable tales, or
wished to acquire importance by making his
adventures savour of the marvellous.</i></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>SOME<br /> <br />ACCOUNT<br /> <br />OF<br /> <br />CAPTAIN J. CARVER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>THERE is a disposition peculiar to
every mind, that early predominates,
and continues its influence through
every period of life. Many circumstances
may, indeed, obscure or divert its
progress; but on all interesting occasions
this constitutional bias will recur, and
exhibit the natural character and genius
of the individual.</p>

<p class='c000'>Jonathan Carver, the author of the
following work, was grandson of William
Joseph Carver, of Wigan, in Lancashire,
who was a captain in the army under
king William, and served in Ireland
with such distinguished reputation, that
that prince was pleased to reward him
with the government of Connecticut in
New-England, which appears to have
been the first appointment to that station
by the crown.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our author was born, anno 1732, at
Stillwater, in the province of Connecticut,
since rendered famous by the surrender
of the army under General Burgoyne;
his father, who resided at this
place, and acted as a justice of the
peace, died, when he was only fifteen
years of age. He had received the rudiments
of as liberal an education as
could be procured in that neighbourhood,
and, being designed for the practice
of medicine, he was soon after his
father’s death placed with a gentleman
of that profession in Elizabeth Town,
in the same province. A profession that
requires not only a close and regular attention,
but likewise a steady perseverance,
was not suited to that spirit of
bold enterprize and adventure, which
seemed to be the ruling passion of our
author, who, at the age of eighteen,
purchased an ensigncy in the Connecticut
regiment, in which, as I have been
informed, he acquired so much reputation,
as to obtain the command of a company.
Of this event, however, I have not
found the least mention among his papers,
nor, indeed, of any other important circumstance
of his life till the year 1757,
when he was in the army under General
Webb, and fortunately escaped the dreadful
massacre at Fort William Henry,
where nearly 1500 brave troops were destroyed
in cold blood by the Indians in
the French army of General Montcalm.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the ensuing year, 1758, a battalion
of light infantry, commanded by Colonel
Oliver Partridge, was raised in the
province of Massachusets Bay, by order
of Governor Pownall, for the purpose of
invading Canada, in which our author
served as second lieutenant of Captain
Hawks’s company; and in 1760 he was
advanced to be captain of a company in
Colonel Whetcomb’s regiment of foot,
during the administration of Governor
Hutchinson. In Governor Barnard’s
time, in 1762, Captain Carver commanded
a company of foot in Colonel
Saltonstall’s regiment.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have not been able to collect any
anecdotes of our author, during his military
services; but from the written recommendations
in my hands, of persons
high in office, under whom he acted, he
appears to have acquitted himself with
great reputation, and much to the satisfaction
of his superior officers. These
recommendations are not confined to
military conduct merely; they uniformly
introduce him as a person of
piety, and of a good moral character.
Throughout the narrative of his travels,
indeed, an animated regard to the
duties of religion is evidently prevalent,
which must procure a credibility to the
facts he mentions, that might otherwise
be suspended. If authors, who have
visited countries unknown to their contemporaries,
had always been actuated
by a sacred regard to truth and moral
rectitude, history in general would have
been developed with just and convincing
relations, and not left involved in
doubt and obscurity.</p>

<p class='c000'>This firm integrity and undaunted
courage appeared evident upon every interesting
occasion: they were, indeed,
essentially requisite to conduct him
through the most dangerous enterprizes
with a perseverance that is more generally
the offspring of true fortitude, than
of daring boldness or impetuosity of imagination.</p>

<p class='c000'>With so many favourable requisites
for success and advancement, descended
from parents respectable for their military
and civil dignity, as well as for
their fortune; endued with courage, sagacity,
and a spirit of enterprize, rarely
united in one individual, it might be an
object of enquiry, why Captain Carver,
whose conduct was so excellent, in a
moral as well as in a military view,
should never have been promoted above
the command of a company.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is a truth confirmed by history, that
true fortitude is the genuine offspring of
an humble mind. Whatever we acquire
by industry and labour, we are apt highly
to estimate; it is a kind of new creation
of our own; and a persuasion of this, inspires
ambition, and even a forward ardour
for distinction; and what a partial
imagination magnifies to ourselves,
we naturally magnify to others, and
gradually acquire a consequence, and
reap rewards adequate, if not superior,
to desert: but the naturally brave is naturally
modest; what is innate, does not
present itself to the imagination as its
own; it neither begets vanity, nor excites
ambition; and thus great endowments,
which might have been cherished, and
turned to the most important advantages,
are frequently neglected, and lost to society.
Whatever natural or acquired
excellencies were possessed by Captain
Carver, not only seemed unnoticed by
himself, but were accompanied by a
diffidence, which in some instances was
extraordinary indeed; and the reader
must be convinced of this, when he is
informed, that Captain Carver died,
through want, with three commissions
in his pocket.</p>

<p class='c000'>The year after his commission under
Colonel Saltonstall was signed, the peace
of Versailles took place, namely, anno
1763, when our author, having discharged
his military obligations to his country,
retired from the army. But his natural
turn for enterprize, and the pursuit of
novelty, did not suffer him to enjoy a
life of useless ease; he began to consider,
to use his own sentiments (having
rendered his country some services during
the war) how he might continue still
serviceable, and contribute, as much as
lay in his power, to make that vast acquisition
of territory, gained by Great
Britain in North America, advantageous
to it; and here he commences his own
biographer, continuing his relation in
the following history of his travels, till
his visit to England in the year 1769.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though I have not been able to procure
many additional anecdotes of this
ingenious traveller, yet a respect to his
memory, and a sense of his services to
the nation at large, excited a desire to
bring together a few outlines of his character,
and probably at some future period,
when the present unhappy contest
between this kingdom and the American
colonies shall have subsided, particulars
of more importance than I have
been able to meet with, may be procured
from that part of the world, which he
has taken so much useful labour to describe.</p>

<p class='c000'>This barrenness of materials is, however,
in some degree compensated by the
important relations he has communicated
in the succeeding pages, which not only
regard himself, but likewise a part of the
great American continent, hitherto almost
unknown to the inhabitants of
Europe, and even to those of the cultivated
parts of the same continent.</p>

<p class='c000'>In his descriptions of these vast regions,
he seems to have embraced every
opportunity of pointing out the advantages
which might be derived in a commercial
view, from a just knowledge of
them, and of the policy of the various
tribes who possess them. In his picturesque
view of the scenery round Lake
Pepin, his imagination, animated as it
was by the magnitude, the novelty, and
grandeur of the objects, is not so far
transported, as to interrupt the most
scrupulous attention to the situation, as
improveable for commercial and national
advantages.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the midst of a new and rich creation,
he suggested the probability of
rendering this lake, and its variegated
environs, the center of immense traffick,
with a people whose names and tribes
were scarcely known to the commercial
parts of either side of the British empire,
but whose dispositions and pursuits
seemed calculated to promote and secure
this interesting and national benefit.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lake, which is about twenty
miles in length, and six in breadth, and
through which the Mississippi directs its
course, is about two thousand miles from
the entrance into the gulf of Mexico,
and as many westerly from Quebec,
Boston, and New-York; it is situated
between 42 and 43 degrees of north
latitude. The plains in its vicinity are
extensive, and fit for immediate cultivation:
elk, deer, and other quadrupeds,
including the beaver, otter, mink,
martin, sable, musk-rat, and the largest
buffaloes in America, are the inhabitants
of this region, whilst various species
of wild fowl frequent the lake,
whose waters are stored with fish in
great abundance; vegetation is luxuriant
in the meadows, where the maple
is indigenous, of whose sap the Indians
make great quantities of sugar, capable of
fermentation, and of producing spirit;
the grapes hang in such clusters, that almost
any quantity of brandy might,
under a like process, be distilled from
them; rice, a grain adapted to many
useful purposes of life, is also very plentiful.</p>

<p class='c000'>The number of hunting Indians, who
frequent Lake Pepin, is not less than
2000, each of whom brings about one
hundred pounds weight of beaver to
barter, which, at the lowest price, in
the London market, is five shillings a
pound; hence a trade at this place will
command annually 200000 crowns worth
of furs, besides skins. But there is reason
to conclude, that when a general
mart is established here, furnished with
a sufficient assortment of goods, and a
supply of liquors, that there would be
a more general resort of traders.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French, indeed, supported a trade
at this lake, before the English had made
a conquest of the country; but they never
attempted the lucrative branch of
distilling spirituous liquors upon the
spot, though they have been conveyed
hither two thousand miles of difficult
carriage, and produced considerable profit.</p>

<p class='c000'>It may be doubted in a moral, if not
in a political view, whether such a
traffic of rendering the means of inebriation
more easily attainable, should meet
with the encouragement of the legislature.
Captain Carver, however, computed
that 2000 gallons of brandy could
be made on the spot, as cheap as in the
West-Indies; and that by avoiding the
expence of 3000 miles carriage also, the
traders would make a saving of 2000 per
cent. besides duties and various contingencies:
and as, by a moderate computation,
every gallon of spirits will produce
there what will amount to ten
pounds in the London market, it must
eventually prove a most lucrative branch
of trade, if pursued with proper caution
and policy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great plenty of the edible necessaries
of life, will afford a cheap, easy,
and salutary supply; and the goodness
of the soil, with very little labour, will
render provisions still more easily attainable,
and altogether form a place of
traffic hitherto unequalled.</p>

<p class='c000'>From Captain Carver’s long residence
in the neighbourhood of Lake Pepin,
among the Naudowissie and <a id='chip'></a>Chipéway
Indians, he acquired a knowledge of
their languages, and an intimacy with
many of their chiefs, which, with his
spirited and judicious conduct in acting
as a mediator between these two nations,
conciliated their attachment and friendship;
and as an acknowledgment of their
grateful sense of his happy interference,
the Naudowissies gave him a formal
grant of a tract of land, lying on the
north side of Lake Pepin. The original,
duly subscribed by two chiefs, is
in my possession; and as an Indian deed
of conveyance may prove a curiosity to
many readers, I shall here insert a copy
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>“To Jonathan Carver, a chief under
the most mighty and potent George
the Third, King of the English and
other nations, the fame of whose
courageous warriors have reached our
ears, and has been more fully told us
by our good brother Jonathan aforesaid,
whom we rejoice to see come
among us, and bring us good news
from his country. We, chiefs of the
Naudowissies, who have hereto set our
seals, do by these presents for ourselves
and heirs for ever, in return for the
many presents, and other good services
done by the said Jonathan to ourselves
and allies, give, grant, and convey to
him the said Jonathan, and to his heirs
and assigns for ever, the whole of a
certain tract or territory of land,
bounded as follows: (viz.) from the
fall of St. Anthony, running on the
east banks of the Mississippi, nearly
south-east, as far as the south end of
Lake Pepin, where the <a id='chip3'></a>Chipéway
river joins the Mississippi, and from
thence eastward five days travel,
accounting twenty English miles per
day, and from thence north six days
travel, at twenty English miles per
day, and from thence again to the fall
of St. Anthony, on a direct straight
line. We do for ourselves, heirs, and
assigns, for ever, give unto the said Jonathan,
his heirs and assigns, for ever,
all the said lands, with all the trees,
rocks, and rivers therein, reserving for
ourselves and heirs the sole liberty of
hunting and fishing on land not planted
or improved by the said Jonathan,
his heirs and assigns, to which we have
affixed our respective seals, at the great
cave, May the first, one thousand seven
hundred and sixty-seven.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after the above period, our author
concluded to return to Boston, where he
arrived in 1768, having been absent two
years and five months, during which time
he had travelled about seven thousand
miles. After digesting his journal and
charts, he sailed for England, and arrived
there in the year 1769. The reasons
which induced him to undertake this
voyage, are amply related by himself in
his travels (page <a href='#Page_177'>177</a>.) to which I
refer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Few objects have excited a more general
enquiry than the discovery of a north-west
passage, in order to open a communication
with the great pacific ocean
and the East Indies, by a shorter navigation
than by doubling those immense
promontories, the Cape of Good Hope
or Cape Horn. Every allurement of
gain, and national emolument, has been
proposed to encourage the attempt, but,
hitherto, every attempt hath been fruitless,
though the most experienced seamen
have engaged in the undertaking.
Our traveller suggested an attempt by
land, across the north west parts of
North America, and actually drew a
chart of his proposed <a id='route'></a>route for effecting
his project, which, however visionary
it may now be deemed, affords at least
a proof of the enterprizing spirit of Captain
Carver, and which he would, probably,
have attempted, had any encouragement
been afforded him: (introd.
<a id='pag'></a>pag. <a href='#Page_vi'>6</a>. and append. pag. <a href='#Page_539'>539</a>, et seq.)</p>

<p class='c000'>When he visited England, he appeared
with the most favourable credentials of
his character in every respect: many of
these are now in my possession; but that
which seemed to promise the most beneficial
advantages, was conferred upon him
by General Gage, and, in consequence of
a petition presented to the king, and referred
to the Lords Commissioners of
Trade and Plantations, our traveller had
formed the fond hope of seeing his labours
so far rewarded, as to be reimbursed
those sums he had expended in the service
of government, agreeable to the relation
conveyed in the introduction to
his travels.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a large, free, and widely extended
government, where every motion depends
upon a variety of springs, the lesser and
subordinate movements must be acted
upon by the greater, and consequently
the more inferior operations of state will
be so distant, as not to be perceived in
the grand machine: whether Captain Carver’s
disappointments resulted from these
principles, or that government did not
estimate his services in equal proportion
to his own idea of them, is not so easily
ascertained, as that he thought himself
not only neglected, but treated with injustice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The condition of a suppliant is what
his mind must have submitted to with reluctance.
Men of superior endowments
are liable to be jealous of the least inattention,
which they are apt to consider
as an insult on their distress. A feeling
mind, like his, conscious of its dignity
and superior merit, might not be able
to stoop to that importunity and adulation,
which are sometimes requisite to
insure the smiles and favours of those in
power; otherwise it might naturally be
suggested, that his extensive acquaintance
with America, and with the customs and
languages of the Indians, in the interior
parts of that vast continent, then the
theatre of an unnatural and bloody contest,
would have pointed him out as a
most useful instrument in the hands of
government.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the advantages, however, of an
intimate knowledge of Indian affairs, he
united a determined loyalty to the king,
and a fixed attachment to his American
countrymen; and thus the principle of
acting agreeably to the feelings of conscience,
would equally operate upon him
respecting the contending parties. He
had repeatedly risked his life in the
service of his prince, against whose
government he was equally averse from
drawing his sword, as against his transatlantic
brethren: he might not, therefore,
be deemed an important acquisition
to the ruling powers here, and the
prayer of his petition was scarcely heard
in the clamours of popular commotion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Persons of ingenuity, however oppressed
by their own sufferings, in a busy
commercial country, may strike out
some means of subsistence; but, in a domestic
state, where many depend upon
the industry of an individual, the difficulty
of procuring support is not only
rendered more affecting to the feeling
mind, but likewise greatly augmented.
Captain Carver, after having exhausted
his fortune, had now a family to support,
without knowing how to turn his abilities
to any means of succouring them.
Distress of mind begets debility of body,
which is still aggravated by penury, and
a want of the common necessaries of life.
His constitution, naturally firm, gradually
grew weaker and weaker; but his
regard to his family animated his spirit
to exertions beyond the strength of his
body, which enabled him to preserve existence
through the winter of 1779, by
acting as a clerk in a lottery-office; but
the vital powers, succoured as they were
by this casual support, diminished by
certain, though imperceptible, degrees,
till at length a putrid fever supervening
a long continued dysentery brought on
by want, put an end to the life of a man,
who, after rendering, at the expence of
fortune and health, and the risk of life,
many important services to his country,
perished through want in the first city of
the world.</p>

<p class='c000'>In size, Captain Carver was rather
above the middle stature, and of a firm
muscular texture; his features expressed a
firmness of mind and boldness of resolution;
and he retained a florid complexion
to his latest moments.</p>

<p class='c000'>In conversation he was social and affable,
where he was familiar; but his extreme
diffidence and modesty kept him in
general reserved in company. In his
familiar epistles, he commanded an easy
and agreeable manner of writing; and
some pieces of his poetry, which have
been communicated to me, afford proofs
of his lively imagination and of the
harmony of his versification.</p>

<p class='c000'>His only authentic publications I have
seen are the present work, and a Treatise
on the Culture of the Tobacco Plant,
anno 1779. The former will speak for
itself: the opinion of the public has,
indeed, been fully testified by the rapid
sale of two large editions of this work
in the space of the last two years.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Treatise on Tobacco is a small
octavo of fifty-four pages, containing
two engravings of the plant, and an account
of its cultivation on the American
continent. As this vegetable constitutes
one of the most considerable branches of
commerce betwixt the old and new
hemispheres of the world, and thrives
luxuriously in Europe as well as in America,
it is now pretty generally known:
from the elegance of the plant and beauty
of its flowers, it is cultivated in gardens
for ornament; in which character it
will appear from a view of the annexed
engraving of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was first sent into Spain, in 1560:
from Tabaco, a province of Yucatan,
by Hermandez de Toledo, and from the
place of its growth it received the name
which it still bears.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id003'>
<img src='images/i033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic001'>
<p><i>Drawn and Engrav’d for Carver’s Travels, as the act directs by F. Sanson N. 16 Maiden Lane Cheapside</i><br /><br />The <span class='sc'>Tobacco Plant</span><br /><br /><i>Published Nov<sup>r</sup>. 1<sup>st</sup>. 1779</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It was called, by the French, Nicotiana,
after John Nicot, who went soon
after it was discovered, as ambassador to
that court, from Francis the Second of
Portugal, and carried some of it with
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before the present contest between
Great-Britain and the Colonies, about
96,000 hogsheads were annually imported
from Maryland and Virginia, which,
with the duties on the home consumption,
and the returns on foreign export,
produced an immense revenue to this
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The general uses of Tobacco are well
known; besides which, it is found nearly
equal to the best oak-bark for tanning
leather, especially with thinner sorts of
hides; and would probably be used for
this purpose, were it as cheap as the bark
of the oak.</p>

<p class='c000'>Few subjects have been more copiously
treated on than Tobacco: Monardes,
Stephanus, Everhartus, Thorius,
Neander, Pauli, have each wrote upon
it largely. Neander published a volume
on this subject, entitled, Tobacologia,
and ornamented it with plates, to exhibit
its cultivation and manner of preparation;
and, lately, Captain Carver
published the above-mentioned Treatise
on the Culture of this Plant, with
a view to instruct landholders in the
method of cultivating it with profit, and
to this pamphlet I shall refer the reader
for further particulars.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our author died on the 31st of January
1780, at the age of forty-eight years,
and lies interred in Holywell-Mount
burying-ground.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>NO sooner was the late War with
France concluded, and Peace established
by the Treaty of Versailles in the
Year 1763, than I began to consider
(having rendered my country some services
during the war) how I might continue
still serviceable, and contribute, as
much as lay in my power, to make that
vast acquisition of territory, gained by
Great Britain, in North America advantageous
to it. It appeared to me indispensably
needful, that Government should
be acquainted in the first place with the
true state of the dominions they were
now become possessed of. To this purpose,
I determined, as the next proof of
my zeal, to explore the most unknown
<span class='pageno' title='ii' id='Page_ii'></span>parts of them, and to spare no trouble or
expence in acquiring a knowledge that
promised to be so useful to my countrymen.
I knew that many obstructions
would arise to my scheme from the want
of good Maps and Charts; for the French,
whilst they retained their power in North
America, had taken every artful method
to keep all other nations, particularly the
English, in ignorance of the concerns of
the interior parts of it: and to accomplish
this design with the greater certainty, they
had published inaccurate maps and false
accounts; calling the different nations of
the Indians by nicknames they had given
them, and not by those really appertaining
to them. Whether the intention of
the French in doing this, was to prevent
these nations from being discovered and
traded with, or to conceal their discourse,
when they talked to each other of the
Indian concerns, in their presence, I will
not determine; but whatsoever was the
<span class='pageno' title='iii' id='Page_iii'></span>cause from which it arose, it tended to
mislead.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a proof that the English had been
greatly deceived by these accounts, and
that their knowledge relative to Canada
had usually been very confined, before the
conquest of Crown-Point in 1759, it had
been esteemed an impregnable fortress:
but no sooner was it taken, than we were
convinced that it had acquired its greatest
security from false reports, given out by
its possessors, and might have been battered
down with a few four pounders. Even
its situation, which was represented to be
so very advantageous, was found to owe
its advantages to the same source. It cannot
be denied but that some maps of these
countries have been published by the
French with an appearance of accuracy;
but these are of so small a size and
drawn on so minute a scale, that they
are nearly inexplicable. The sources of
the Mississippi, I can assert from my
<span class='pageno' title='iv' id='Page_iv'></span>own experience, are greatly misplaced; for
when I had explored them, and compared
their situation with the French Charts, I
found them very erroneously represented,
and am satisfied that these were only copied
from the rude sketches of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even so lately as their evacuation of
Canada they continued their schemes to
deceive; leaving no traces by which any
knowledge might accrue to their conquerors:
for though they were well acquainted
with all the Lakes, particularly
with Lake Superior, having constantly a
vessel of considerable burthen thereon, yet
their plans of them are very incorrect. I
discovered many errors in the descriptions
given therein of its Islands and Bays,
during a progress of eleven hundred miles
that I coasted it in canoes. They likewise,
on giving up the possession of them,
took care to leave the places they had occupied
in the same uncultivated state they
had found them; at the same time destroying
<span class='pageno' title='v' id='Page_v'></span>all their naval force. I observed
myself part of the hulk of a very large
vessel, burnt to the water’s edge, just at
the opening from the Straits of St. Marie’s
into the Lake.</p>

<p class='c000'>These difficulties, however, were not
sufficient to deter me from the undertaking,
and I made preparations for setting
out. What I chiefly had in view, after
gaining a knowledge of the Manners, Customs,
Languages, Soil, and natural Productions
of the different nations that inhabit
the back of the Mississippi, was to
ascertain the Breadth of that vast continent,
which extends from the Atlantic to
the Pacific Ocean, in its broadest part between
43 and 46 Degrees Northern Latitude.
Had I been able to accomplish
this, I intended to have proposed to Government
to establish a Post in some of
those parts about the Straits of Annian,
which having been first discovered by Sir
Francis Drake, of course belong to the
<span class='pageno' title='vi' id='Page_vi'></span>English. This I am convinced would
greatly facilitate the discovery of a North-west
Passage, or a communication between
Hudson’s Bay and the Pacific Ocean. An
event so desirable, and which has been so
often sought for, but without success. Besides
this important end, a settlement on
that extremity of America would answer
many good purposes, and repay every expence
the establishment of it might occasion.
For it would not only disclose new
sources of trade, and promote many useful
discoveries, but would open a passage
for conveying intelligence to China, and
the English settlements in the East Indies,
with greater expedition than a tedious
voyage by the Cape of Good Hope, or
the Straits of Magellan will allow of.</p>

<p class='c000'>How far the advantages arising from
such an enterprize may extend can only be
ascertained by the favourable concurrence
of future events. But that the completion
of the scheme, I have had the honour of
<span class='pageno' title='vii' id='Page_vii'></span>first planning and attempting, will some
time or other be effected, I make no
doubt. From the unhappy divisions that
at present subsist between Great Britain
and America, it will probably be some
years before the attempt is repeated; but
whenever it is, and the execution of it
carried on with propriety, those who are
so fortunate as to succeed, will reap, exclusive
of the national advantages that
must ensue, Emoluments beyond their
most sanguine expectations. And whilst
their spirits are elated by their success,
perhaps they may bestow some commendations
and blessings on the person that
first pointed out to them the way. These,
though but a shadowy recompence for all
my toil, I shall receive with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c000'>To what power or authority this new
world will become dependent, after it has
arisen from its present uncultivated state,
time alone can discover. But as the seat
of Empire from time immemorial has been
<span class='pageno' title='viii' id='Page_viii'></span>gradually progressive towards the West,
there is no doubt but that at some future
period, mighty kingdoms will emerge
from these wildernesses, and stately palaces
and solemn temples, with gilded spires
reaching the skies, supplant the Indian huts,
whose only decorations are the barbarous
trophies of their vanquished enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>As some of the preceding passages have
already informed the Reader that the plan
I had laid down for penetrating to the
Pacific Ocean, proved abortive, it is necessary
to add, that this proceeded not
from its impracticability (for the farther
I went the more convinced I was that it
could certainly be accomplished) but from
unforeseen disappointments. However,
I proceeded so far, that I was able to
make such discoveries as will be useful in
any future attempt, and prove a good
foundation for some more fortunate Successor
to build upon. These I shall now
lay before the Public in the following
<span class='pageno' title='ix' id='Page_ix'></span>pages; and am satisfied that the greatest
part of them have never been published
by any person that has hitherto treated of
the interior Nations of the Indians; particularly,
the account I give of the Naudowessies,
and the situation of the Heads
of the four great rivers that take their rise
within a few leagues of each other, nearly
about the center of this great continent;
viz. The River Bourbon, which
empties itself into Hudson’s Bay; the
Waters of Saint Lawrence; the Mississippi,
and the River Oregon, or the River
of the West, that falls into the Pacific
Ocean at the Straits of Annian.</p>

<p class='c000'>The impediments that occasioned my
returning, before I had accomplished my
purposes, were these. On my arrival at
Michillimackinac, the remotest English
post, in September 1766, I applied to
Mr. Rogers, who was then governor of
it, to furnish me with a proper assortment
of goods, as presents for the Indians who
<span class='pageno' title='x' id='Page_x'></span>inhabit the track I intended to pursue.
He did this only in part; but promised to
supply me with such as were necessary,
when I reached the Falls of Saint Anthony.
I afterwards learned that the
governor fulfilled his promise in ordering
the goods to be delivered to me; but
those to whose care he intrusted them, instead
of conforming to his orders, disposed
of them elsewhere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Disappointed in my expectations from
this quarter, I thought it necessary to return
to La Prairié Le Chien; for it was
impossible to proceed any farther without
presents to ensure me a favorable reception.
This I did in the beginning of the
year 1767, and finding my progress to
the Westward thus retarded, I determined
to direct my course Northward. I took
this step with a view of finding a communication
from the Heads of the Mississippi
into Lake Superior, in order to meet, at
the grand Portage on the North-west side
<span class='pageno' title='xi' id='Page_xi'></span>of that lake, the traders that usually come,
about this season, from Michillimackinac.
Of these I intended to purchase goods,
and then to pursue my journey from that
quarter by way of the lakes de Pluye,
Dubois, and Ounipique to the Heads of
the river of the West, which, as I have
said before, falls into the Straits of Annian,
the termination of my intended progress.</p>

<p class='c000'>I accomplished the former part of my
design, and reached Lake Superior in
proper time; but unluckily the traders I
met there acquainted me, that they had no
goods to spare; those they had with them
being barely sufficient to answer their own
demands in these remote parts. Thus disappointed
a second time, I found myself
obliged to return to the place from whence
I began my expedition, which I did after
continuing some months on the North and
East borders of Lake Superior, and exploring
the Bays and Rivers that empty themselves
into this large body of water.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='xii' id='Page_xii'></span>As it may be expected that I should
lay before the Public the reasons that
these discoveries, of so much importance
to every one who has any connections
with America, have not been imparted to
them before, notwithstanding they were
made upwards of ten years ago, I will
give them to the world in a plain and
candid manner, and without mingling
with them any complaints on account of
the ill treatment I have received.</p>

<p class='c000'>On my arrival in England, I presented
a petition to his Majesty in council, praying
for a reimbursement of those sums I
had expended in the service of government.
This was referred to the Lords Commissioners
of Trade and Plantations. Their
Lordships from the tenor of it thought
the intelligence I could give of so much
importance to the nation that they ordered
me to appear before the Board.
This message I obeyed, and underwent
a long examination; much I believe to
<span class='pageno' title='xiii' id='Page_xiii'></span>the satisfaction of every Lord present.
When it was finished, I requested to
know what I should do with my papers;
without hesitation the first Lord replied,
That I might publish them whenever I
pleased. In consequence of this permission,
I disposed of them to a bookseller:
but when they were nearly ready for the
press, an order was issued from the council
board, requiring me to deliver, without
delay, into the Plantation Office, all my
Charts and Journals, with every paper relative
to the discoveries I had made. In
order to obey this command, I was obliged
to re-purchase them from the bookseller,
at a very great expence, and deliver
them up. This fresh disbursement I endeavoured
to get annexed to the account I
had already delivered in; but the request
was denied me, notwithstanding I had
only acted, in the disposal of my papers,
conformably to the permission I had received
from the Board of Trade. This
<span class='pageno' title='xiv' id='Page_xiv'></span>loss, which amounted to a very considerable
sum, I was obliged to bear, and to
rest satisfied with an indemnification for
my other expences.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus situated, my only expectations
are from the favour of a generous Public;
to whom I shall now communicate my
Plans, Journals, and Observations, of
which I luckily kept copies, when I delivered
the originals into the Plantation
Office. And this I do the more readily,
as I hear they are mislaid; and there is
no probability of their ever being published.
To those who are interested in the
concerns of the interior parts of North
America, from the contiguity of their
possessions, or commercial engagements,
they will be extremely useful, and fully
repay the sum at which they are purchased.
To those, who, from a laudable
curiosity, wish to be acquainted with the
manners and customs of every inhabitant
of this globe, the accounts here given of
<span class='pageno' title='xv' id='Page_xv'></span>the various nations that inhabit so vast a
track of it, a country hitherto almost unexplored,
will furnish an ample fund of
amusement and gratify their most curious
expectations. And I flatter myself they
will be as favourably received by the
Public, as descriptions of islands, which
afford no other entertainment than what
arises from their novelty; and discoveries,
that seem to promise very few advantages
to this country, though acquired at an
immense expence.</p>

<p class='c000'>To make the following Work as comprehensible
and entertaining as possible, I
shall first give my Readers an account of
the route I pursued over this immense
continent (through which they will be
able to attend me by referring to the plan
prefixed) and as I pass on, describe the
number of Inhabitants, the situation of
the Rivers and Lakes, and the productions
of the country. Having done this, I
shall treat, in distinct Chapters, of the
<span class='pageno' title='xvi' id='Page_xvi'></span>Manners, Customs, and Languages of the
Indians, and to complete the whole, add
a Vocabulary of the Words mostly in use
among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>And here it is necessary to bespeak the
candour of the learned part of my Readers
in the perusal of it, as it is the production
of a person unused, from opposite
avocations, to literary pursuits. He therefore
begs they would not examine it with
too critical an eye; especially when he
assures them that his attention has been
more employed on giving a just description
of a country that promises, in some
future period, to be an inexhaustible source
of riches to that people who shall be so
fortunate as to possess it, than on the style
or composition; and more careful to render
his language intelligible and explicit,
than smooth and florid.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>IN June 1766, I set out from Boston,
and proceeded by way of Albany and
Niagara, to Michillimackinac; a Fort
situated between the Lakes Huron and
Michigan, and distant from Boston 1300
miles. This being the uttermost of our
factories towards the north-west, I considered
it as the most convenient place
from whence I could begin my intended
progress, and enter at once into the Regions
I designed to explore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Referring my Readers to the publications
already extant for an Account of
those Parts of North America, that, from
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span>lying adjacent to the Back-Settlements,
have been frequently described, I shall
confine myself to a Description of the more
interior parts of it, which having been but
seldom visited, are consequently but little
known. In doing this, I shall in no instance
exceed the bounds of truth, or have
recourse to those useless and extravagant
exaggerations too often made use of by
travellers, to excite the curiosity of the
public, or to increase their own importance.
Nor shall I insert any observations, but
such as I have made myself, or, from
the credibility of those by whom they
were related, am enabled to vouch for their
authenticity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Michillimackinac, from whence I began
my travels, is a Fort composed of a
strong stockade, and is usually defended
by a garrison of one hundred men. It
contains about thirty houses, one of
which belongs to the governor, and another
to the commissary. Several traders
also dwell within its fortifications, who
find it a convenient situation to traffic
with the neighbouring nations. Michillimackinac,
in the language of the Chipéway
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span>Indians, signifies a Tortoise; and the
place is supposed to receive its name from
an Island, lying about six or seven miles to
the north-east, within light of the Fort,
which has the appearance of that animal.</p>

<p class='c000'>During the Indian war that followed
soon after the Conquest of Canada
in the year 1763, and which was
carried on by an army of confederate
nations composed of the Hurons, Miamies,
Chipéways, Ottowaws, Pontowattimies,
Mississauges, and some other tribes,
under the direction of Pontiac, a celebrated
Indian warrior, who had always
been in the French interest, it was taken
by surprize in the following manner:
The Indians having settled their plan,
drew near the Fort, and began a game at
Ball, a pastime much used among them,
and not unlike tennis. In the height of
their game, at which some of the English
officers, not suspecting any deceit, stood
looking on, they struck the ball, as if
by accident, over the stockade; this
they repeated two or three times, to
make the deception more complete; till
at length, having by this means lulled
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span>every suspicion of the centry at the south
gate, a party rushed by him; and the rest
soon following, they took possession of
the Fort, without meeting with any opposition.
Having accomplished their design,
the Indians had the humanity to
spare the lives of the greatest part of the
garrison and traders, but they made them
all prisoners, and carried them off. However
some time after they took them to
Montreal, where they were redeemed at a
good price. The Fort also was given up
again to the English at the peace made
with Pontiac by the commander of Detroit
the year following.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having here made the necessary dispositions
for pursuing my travels, and
obtained a credit from Mr. Rogers, the
governor, on some English and Canadian
traders who were going to trade on the
Mississippi, and received also from him
a promise of a fresh supply of goods
when I reached the Falls of Saint Anthony,
I left the Fort on the 3d of September,
in company with these traders.
It was agreed, that they should furnish
me with such goods as I might want,
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span>for presents to the Indian chiefs, during
my continuance with them, agreeable to
the governor’s order. But when I arrived
at the extent of their route, I was to
find other guides, and to depend on the
goods the governor had promised to supply
me with.</p>

<p class='c000'>We accordingly set out together, and
on the 18th arrived at Fort La Bay.
This Fort is situated on the southern extremity
of a Bay in Lake Michigan,
termed by the French the Bay of Puants;
but which, since the English have
gained possession of all the settlements on
this part of the Continent, is called by
them the Green Bay. The reason of its
being thus denominated, is from its appearance;
for on leaving Michillimackinac
in the spring season, though the trees there
have not even put forth their buds, yet
you find the country around La Bay, notwithstanding
the passage has not exceeded
fourteen days, covered with the finest verdure,
and vegetation as forward as it could
be were it summer.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Fort, also, is only surrounded
by a stockade, and being much decayed
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>is scarcely defensible against small arms.
It was built by the French for the protection
of their trade, some time before
they were forced to relinquish it; and
when Canada and its dependencies were
surrendered to the English, it was immediately
garrisoned with an officer and
thirty men. These were made prisoners
by the Menomonies soon after the surprise
of Michillimackinac, and the Fort
has neither been garrisoned or kept in repair
since.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Bay is about ninety miles long,
but differs much in its breadth; being in
some places only fifteen miles, in others
from twenty to thirty. It lies nearly
from north-east to south-west. At the entrance
of it from the Lake are a string of
islands, extending from north to south, called
the Grand Traverse. These are about
thirty miles in length, and serve to facilitate
the passage of canoes, as they shelter
them from the winds, which sometimes
come with violence across the Lake. On
the side that lies to the south-east is the
nearest and best navigation.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>The islands of the Grand Traverse are
mostly small and rocky. Many of the
rocks are of an amazing size, and appear
as if they had been fashioned by the
hands of artists. On the largest and best
of these islands stands a town of the
Ottowaws, at which I found one of the
most considerable chiefs of that nation,
who received me with every honour he
could possibly show to a stranger. But
what appeared extremely singular to me
at the time, and must do so to every
person unacquainted with the customs of
the Indians, was the reception I met
with on landing. As our canoes approached
the shore, and had reached within
about threescore rods of it, the Indians
began a feu-de-joy; in which they
fired their pieces loaded with balls; but
at the same time they took care to discharge
them in such a manner, as to
fly a few yards above our heads: during
this they ran from one tree or stump to
another, shouting and behaving as if
they were in the heat of battle. At first
I was greatly <a id='sur'></a>surprised, and was on the
point of ordering my attendants to return
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span>their fire, concluding that their intentions
were hostile; but being undeceived by
some of the traders, who informed me
that this was their usual method of receiving
the chiefs of other nations, I considered
it in its true light, and was pleased
with the respect thus paid me.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remained here one night. Among
the presents I made the chiefs, were some
spirituous liquors; with which they made
themselves merry, and all joined in a
dance, that lasted the greatest part of the
night. In the morning when I departed,
the chief attended me to the shore, and,
as soon as I had embarked, offered up, in
an audible voice, and with great solemnity,
a fervent prayer in my behalf. He
prayed “that the Great Spirit would favour
me with a prosperous voyage; that
he would give me an unclouded sky, and
smooth waters, by day, and that I might
lie down, by night, on a beaver blanket,
enjoying uninterrupted sleep, and pleasant
dreams; and also that I might find continual
protection under the great pipe of
peace.” In this manner he continued
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span>his petitions till I could no longer hear
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must here observe, that notwithstanding
the inhabitants of Europe are apt
to entertain horrid ideas of the ferocity
of these savages, as they are termed, I
received from every tribe of them in the
interior parts, the most hospitable and
courteous treatment; and am convinced,
that till they are contaminated by the
example and spirituous liquors of their
more refined neighbours, they retain this
friendly and inoffensive conduct towards
strangers. Their inveteracy and cruelty
to their enemies I acknowledge to be a
great abatement of the favourable opinion
I would wish to entertain of them; but
this failing is hereditary, and having received
the sanction of immemorial custom,
has taken too deep root in their minds to
be ever extirpated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among this people I eat of a very uncommon
kind of bread. The Indians, in
general, use but little of this nutritious
food: whilst their corn is in the milk, as
they term it, that is, just before it begins
<span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span>to ripen, they slice off the kernels
from the cob to which they grow, and
knead them into a paste. This they are
enabled to do without the addition of any
liquid, by the milk that flows from them;
and when it is effected, they parcel it out
into cakes, and inclosing them in leaves
of the basswood tree, place them in hot
embers, where they are soon baked. And
better flavoured bread I never eat in any
country.</p>

<p class='c000'>This place is only a small village containing
about twenty-five houses and sixty
or seventy warriors. I found nothing
there worthy of further remark.</p>

<p class='c000'>The land on the south-east side of the
Green Bay is but very indifferent, being
overspread with a heavy growth of hemlock,
pine, spruce and fir trees. The
communication between Lake Michigan
and the Green Bay has been reported by
some to be impracticable for the passage
of any vessels larger than canoes or boats,
on account of the shoals that lie between
the islands in the Grand Traverse; but
on sounding it I found sufficient depth
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>for a vessel of sixty tons, and the breadth
proportionable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The land adjoining to the bottom of
this Bay is very fertile, the country in
general level, and the perspective view of
it pleasing and extensive.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few families live in the Fort, which
lies on the west-side of the Fox River, and
opposite to it, on the east side of its entrance,
are some French settlers who cultivate
the land, and appear to live very
comfortably.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Green Bay or Bay of Puants is
one of those places to which the French,
as I have mentioned in the Introduction,
have given nicknames. It is termed by the
inhabitants of its coasts, the Menomonie
Bay; but why the French have denominated
it the Puant or Stinking Bay I
know not. The reason they themselves
give for it is, that it was not with a view
to mislead strangers, but that by adopting
this method they could converse with
each other, concerning the Indians, in
their presence, without being understood
by them. For it was remarked by the
persons who first traded among them, that
when they were speaking to each other
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span>about them, and mentioned their proper
name, they instantly grew suspicious, and
concluded that their visiters were either
speaking ill of them, or plotting their destruction.
To remedy this they gave
them some other name. The only bad
consequence arising from the practice then
introduced is, that English and French
geographers, in their plans of the interior
parts of America, give different names to
the same people, and thereby perplex those
who have occasion to refer to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake Michigan, of which the Green
Bay is a part, is divided on the north-east
from Lake Huron by the Straits of
Michillimackinac; and is situated between
forty-two and forty-six degrees of
latitude, and between eighty-four and
eighty-seven degrees of west longitude.
Its greatest length is two hundred and
eighty miles, its breadth about forty,
and its circumference nearly six hundred.
There is a remarkable string of small
islands beginning over against Atkin’s Farm,
and running about thirty miles south-west
into the Lake. These are called
the Beaver Islands. Their situation is very
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>pleasant, but the soil is bare. However
they afford a beautiful prospect.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the north-west parts of this Lake
the waters branch out into two bays. That
which lies towards the north is the Bay
of Noquets, and the other the Green Bay
just described.</p>

<p class='c000'>The waters of this as well as the other
great Lakes are clear and wholesome, and
of sufficient depth for the navigation of
large ships. Half the space of the country
that lies to the east, and extends to
Lake Huron, belongs to the Ottowaw
Indians. The line that divides their territories
from the Chipéways, runs nearly
north and south, and reaches almost
from the southern extremity of this Lake,
across the high lands, to Michillimackinac,
through the center of which it passes. So
that when these two tribes happen to meet
at the factory, they each encamp on their
own dominions, at a few yards distance
from the stockade.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country adjacent either to the
east or west side of this lake is composed
but of an indifferent soil, except where
small brooks or rivers empty themselves
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span>into it; on the banks of these it is extremely
fertile. Near the borders of the
Lake grow a great number of sand cherries,
which are not less remarkable for
their manner of growth, than for their exquisite
flavour. They grow upon a small
shrub not more than four feet high, the
boughs of which are so loaded that they
lie in clusters on the sand. As they
grow only on the sand, the warmth of
which probably contributes to bring them
to such perfection, they are called by the
French, cherries de sable, or sand cherries.
The size of them does not exceed that of a
small musket ball, but they are reckoned
superior to any other sort for the purpose
of steeping in spirits. There also grow
around the Lake gooseberries, black currants,
and an abundance of juniper, bearing
great quantities of berries of the finest
sort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sumack likewise grows here in great
plenty; the leaf of which, gathered at
Michaelmas when it turns red, is much
esteemed by the natives. They mix
about an equal quantity of it with their
tobacco, which causes it to smoke pleasantly.
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>Near this Lake, and indeed
about all the great lakes, is found a kind
of willow, termed by the French, bois
rouge, in English red wood. Its bark,
when only of one year’s growth, is of a
fine scarlet colour, and appears very beautiful;
but as it grows older, it changes
into a mixture of grey and red. The
stalks of this shrub grow many of them
together, and rise to the height of six or
eight feet, the largest not exceeding an
inch diameter. The bark being scraped
from the sticks, and dried and powdered,
is also mixed by the Indians with their
tobacco, and is held by them in the
highest estimation for their winter smoaking.
A weed that grows near the great
lakes, in rocky places, they use in the
summer season. It is called by the Indians,
Segockimac, and creeps like a vine
on the ground, sometimes extending to
eight or ten feet, and bearing a leaf about
the size of a silver penny, nearly round;
it is of the substance and colour of the
laurel, and is, like the tree it resembles,
an evergreen. These leaves, dried and
powdered, they likewise mix with their
<span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span>tobacco; and, as said before, smoak it
only during the summer. By these three
succedaneums the pipes of the Indians are
well supplied through every season of the
year; and as they are great smoakers, they
are very careful in properly gathering and
preparing them.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 20th of September I left the
Green Bay, and proceeded up Fox River,
still in company with the traders and some
Indians. On the 25th I arrived at the
great town of the Winnebagoes, situated
on a small island just as you enter the
east end of Lake Winnebago. Here the
queen who presided over this tribe instead
of a Sachem, received me with great civility,
and entertained me in a very distinguished
manner, during the four days
I continued with her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The day after my arrival I held a
council with the chiefs, of whom I asked
permission to pass through their country,
in my way to more remote nations
on business of importance. This was
readily granted me, the request being
esteemed by them as a great compliment
paid to their tribe. The Queen sat in
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>the council, but only asked a few questions,
or gave some trifling directions in
matters relative to the state; for women
are never allowed to sit in their councils,
except they happen to be invested with
the supreme authority, and then it is not
customary for them to make any formal
speeches as the chiefs do. She was a very
ancient woman, small in stature, and not
much distinguished by her dress from
several young women that attended her.
These her attendants seemed greatly pleased
whenever I showed any tokens of respect
to their queen, particularly when I saluted
her, which I frequently did to acquire
her favour. On these occasions the good
old lady endeavoured to assume a juvenile
gaiety, and by her smiles showed she
was equally pleased with the attention I
paid her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The time I tarried here, I employed in
making the best observations possible on
the country, and in collecting the most
certain intelligence I could of the origin,
language, and customs of this people. From
these enquiries I have reason to conclude,
that the Winnebagoes originally resided in
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>some of the provinces belonging to New
Mexico; and being driven from their native
country, either by intestine divisions,
or by the extension of the Spanish conquests,
they took refuge in these more
northern parts about a century ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>My reasons for adopting this supposition,
are, first from their unalienable attachment
to the Naudowessie Indians (who,
they say, gave them the earliest succour
during their emigration) notwithstanding
their present residence is more than six
hundred miles distant from that people.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, that their dialect totally differs
from every other Indian nation yet
discovered; it being a very uncouth guttural
jargon, which none of their neighbours
will attempt to learn. They converse
with other nations in the Chipéway
tongue, which is the prevailing language
throughout all the tribes, from the Mohawks
of Canada to those who inhabit the
borders of the Mississippi, and from the
Hurons and Illinois to such as dwell near
Hudson’s Bay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirdly, from their inveterate hatred
to the Spaniards. Some of them informed
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>me that they had made many <a id='excu'></a>excursions
to the south-west, which took
up several moons. An elderly chief more
particularly acquainted me, that about
forty-six winters ago, he marched, at the
head of fifty warriors, towards the south-west,
for three moons. That during this
expedition, whilst they were crossing a
plain, they discovered a body of men on
horseback, who belonged to the Black
People; for so they call the Spaniards.
As soon as they perceived them, they proceeded
with caution, and concealed themselves
till night came on; when they
drew so near as to be able to discern the
number and situation of their enemies.
Finding they were not able to cope with
so great a superiority by day-light, they
waited till they had retired to rest; when
they rushed upon them, and, after having
killed the greatest part of the men,
took eighty horses loaded with what they
termed white stone. This I suppose to
have been silver, as he told me the horses
were shod with it, and that their bridles
were ornamented with the same. When
they had satiated their revenge, they carried
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span>off their spoil, and being got so far
as to be out of the reach of the Spaniards
that had escaped their fury, they left the
useless and ponderous burthen, with which
the horses were loaded, in the woods, and
mounting themselves, in this manner returned
to their friends. The party they
had thus defeated, I conclude to be the
caravan that annually conveys to Mexico,
the silver which the Spaniards find in
great quantities on the mountains lying
near the heads of the Coloredo River: and
the plains where the attack was made,
probably, some they were obliged to pass
over in their way to the heads of the River
St. Fee, or Rio del Nord, which falls
into the Gulph of Mexico to the west of
the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Winnebagoes can raise about two
hundred warriors. Their town contains
about fifty houses, which are strongly built
with palisades, and the island on which it
is situated nearly fifty acres. It lies thirty-five
miles, reckoning according to the course
of the river, from the Green Bay.</p>

<p class='c000'>The River, for about four or five miles
from the Bay, has a gentle current; after
<span class='pageno' title='37' id='Page_37'></span>that space, till you arrive at the Winnebago
Lake, it is full of rocks and very <a id='rapid'></a>rapid.
At many places we were obliged to
land our canoes, and carry them a considerable
way. Its breadth, in general, from
the Green Bay to the Winnebago Lake, is
between seventy and a hundred yards: the
land on its borders very good, and thinly
wooded with hickery, oak, and hazel.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Winnebago Lake is about fifteen
miles long from east to west, and six miles
wide. At its south-east corner, a river
falls into it that takes its rise near some
of the northern branches of the Illinois
River. This I called the Crocodile River,
in consequence of a story that prevails
among the Indians, of their having
destroyed, in some part of it, an animal,
which from their description must be a
crocodile or an alligator.</p>

<p class='c000'>The land adjacent to the Lake is very
fertile, abounding with grapes, plums, and
other fruits, which grow spontaneously.
The Winnebagoes raise on it a great quantity
of Indian corn, beans, pumpkins,
squash, and water melons, with some tobacco.
The Lake itself abounds with
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span>fish, and in the fall of the year, with geese,
ducks, and teal. The latter, which resort
to it in great numbers, are remarkably
good and extremely fat, and are much better
flavoured than those that are found
near the sea, as they acquire their excessive
fatness by feeding on the wild rice, which
grow so plentifully in these parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having made some acceptable presents
to the good old queen, and received her
blessing, I left the town of the Winnebagoes
on the 29th of September, and
about twelve miles from it arrived at the
place where the Fox River enters the Lake
on the north side of it. We proceeded
up this river, and on the 7th of October
reached the great Carrying Place, which
divides it from the Ouisconsin.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fox River, from the Green Bay
to the Carrying Place, is about one hundred
and eighty miles. From the Winnebago
Lake to the Carrying Place the current
is gentle, and the depth of it considerable;
notwithstanding which, in some
places it is with difficulty that canoes can
pass, through the obstructions they meet
with from the rice stalks, which are very
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>large and thick, and grow here in great
abundance. The country around it is
very fertile and proper in the highest degree
for cultivation, excepting in some
places near the River, where it is rather
too low. It is in no part very woody,
and yet can supply sufficient to answer the
demands of any number of inhabitants.
This river is the greatest resort for wild
fowl of every kind that I met with in the
whole course of my travels; frequently the
sun would be obscured by them for some
minutes together.</p>

<p class='c000'>About forty miles up this river, from
the great town of the Winnebagoes, stands
a smaller town belonging to that nation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Deer and bears are very numerous in
these parts, and a great many beavers and
other furs are taken on the streams that
empty themselves into this river.</p>

<p class='c000'>The River I am treating of, is remarkable
for having been, about eighty years
ago, the residence of the united bands of
the Ottigaumies and the Saukies, whom
the French had nicknamed, according to
their wonted custom, Des Sacs and Des
Reynards, the Sacks and the Foxes, of
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>whom the following anecdote was related
to me by an Indian.</p>

<p class='c000'>About sixty years ago, the French
missionaries and traders having received
many insults from these people, a party
of French and Indians under the command
of Captain Morand marched to revenge
their wrongs. The captain set out
from the Green Bay in the winter, when
they were unsuspicious of a visit of this
kind, and pursuing his route over the snow
to their villages, which lay about fifty
miles up the Fox River, came upon them
by surprize. Unprepared as they were,
he found them an easy conquest, and
consequently killed or took prisoners the
greatest part of them. On the return of
the French to the Green Bay, one of the
Indian chiefs in alliance with them, who
had a considerable band of the prisoners
under his care, stopped to drink at a
brook; in the mean time his companions
went on: which being observed by one
of the women whom they had made captive,
she suddenly seized him with both
her hands, whilst he stooped to drink,
by an exquisitely susceptible part, and held
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>him fast till he expired on the spot. As
the chief, from the extreme torture he
suffered, was unable to call out to his
friends, or to give any alarm, they passed
on without knowing what had happened;
and the woman having cut the bands of
those of her fellow prisoners who were
in the rear, with them made her escape.
This heroine was ever after treated by her
nation as their deliverer, and made a chiefess
in her own right, with liberty to entail
the same honour on her descendants:
an unusual distinction, and permitted only
on extraordinary occasions.</p>

<p class='c000'>About twelve miles before I reached the
Carrying Place, I observed several small
mountains which extended quite to it.
These indeed would only be esteemed as
molehills when compared with those on the
back of the colonies, but as they were the
first I had seen since my leaving Niagara,
a track of nearly eleven hundred miles, I
could not leave them unnoticed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Fox River, where it enters the
Winnebago Lake, is about fifty yards
wide, but it gradually decreases to the
Carrying Place, where it is no more than
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span>five yards over, except in a few places
where it widens into small lakes, though
still of a considerable depth. I cannot recollect
any thing else that is remarkable in
this River, except that it so serpentines for
five miles, as only to gain in that place
one quarter of a mile.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Carrying Place between the Fox
and Ouisconsin Rivers is in breadth not
more than a mile and three quarters,
though in some maps it is so delineated as
to appear to be ten miles. And here I
cannot help remarking, that all the maps
of these parts, I have ever seen, are very
erroneous. The rivers in general are described
as running in different directions
from what they really do; and many
branches of them, particularly of the Mississippi,
omitted. The distances of places,
likewise, are greatly misrepresented. Whether
this is done by the French geographers
(for the English maps are all copied
from theirs) through design, or for
want of a just knowledge of the country,
I cannot say; but I am satisfied that travellers
who depend upon them in the parts
I visited, will find themselves much at a
<span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span>loss. Having surveyed with the greatest
care, every country through which I
passed, I can assert that the plan prefixed
to this work is drawn with much greater
precision than any extant.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near one half of the way, between
the rivers, is a morass overgrown with a
kind of long grass, the rest of it a plain,
with some few oak and pine trees growing
thereon. I observed here a great
number of rattle-snakes. Mons. Pinnisance,
a French trader, told me a remarkable
story concerning one of these reptiles,
of which he said he was an eye-witness.
An Indian, belonging to the
Menomonie nation, having taken one of
them, found means to tame it; and when
he had done this, treated it as a Deity;
calling it his Great Father, and carrying
it with him in a box wherever he
went. This the Indian had done for several
summers, when Mons. Pinnisance
accidentally met with him at this Carrying
Place, just as he was setting off for a
winter’s hunt. The French gentleman
was surprized, one day, to see the Indian
place the box which contained his god on
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span>the ground, and opening the door give
him his liberty; telling him, whilst he
did it, to be sure and return by the time
he himself should come back, which was
to be in the month of May following.
As this was but October, Monsieur told
the Indian, whose simplicity astonished
him, that he fancied he might wait long
enough when May arrived, for the arrival
of his great father. The Indian was so
confident of his creature’s obedience, that
he offered to lay the Frenchman a wager
of two gallons of rum, that at the time
appointed he would come and crawl into
his box. This was agreed on, and the
second week in May following fixed for
the determination of the wager. At that
period they both met there again; when
the Indian set down his box, and called
for his great father. The snake heard
him not; and the time being now expired,
he acknowledged that he had lost.
However, without seeming to be discouraged,
he offered to double the bett if
his great father came not within two
days more. This was further agreed on;
when behold on the second day, about
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span>one o’clock, the snake arrived, and, of his
own accord, crawled into the box, which
was placed ready for him. The French
gentleman vouched for the truth of this
story, and from the accounts I have often
received of the docility of those creatures,
I see no reason to doubt his veracity.</p>

<p class='c000'>I observed that the main body of the
Fox River came from the south-west,
that of the Ouisconsin from the north-east;
and also that some of the small
branches of these two rivers, in descending
into them, doubled, within a few
feet of each other, a little to the south
of the Carrying Place. That two such
Rivers should take their rise so near each
other, and after running such different
courses, empty themselves into the sea
at a distance so amazing (for the former
having passed through several great lakes,
and run upwards of two thousand miles,
falls into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and
the other, after joining the Mississippi,
and having run an equal number of
miles, disembogues itself into the Gulph
of Mexico) is an instance scarcely to be
met in the extensive continent of North
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>America. I had an opportunity the year
following, of making the same observations
on the affinity of various head
branches of the waters of the St. Lawrence
and the Mississippi to each other;
and now bring them as a proof, that the
opinion of those geographers, who assert,
that rivers taking their rise so near each
other, must spring from the same source,
is erroneous. For I perceived a visibly
distinct separation in all of them, notwithstanding,
in some places, they approached
so near, that I could have stepped from
one to the other.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 8th of October we got our canoes
into the Ouisconsin River, which at
this place is more than a hundred yards
wide; and the next day arrived at the
Great Town of the Saukies. This is the
largest and best built Indian town I ever
saw. It contains about ninety houses, each
large enough for several families. These
are built of hewn plank neatly jointed,
and covered with bark so compactly as to
keep out the most penetrating rains. Before
the doors are placed comfortable sheds,
in which the inhabitants sit, when the
weather will permit, and smoak their
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span>pipes. The streets are regular and spacious;
so that it appears more like a civilized
town than the abode of savages. The
land near the town is very good. In their
plantations, which lie adjacent to their
houses, and which are neatly laid out,
they raise great quantities of Indian corn,
beans, melons, &amp;c. so that this place is
esteemed the best market for traders to furnish
themselves with provisions, of any
within eight hundred miles of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Saukies can raise about three hundred
warriors, who are generally employed
every summer in making incursions into
the territories of the Illinois and Pawnee
nations, from whence they return with a
great number of slaves. But those people
frequently retaliate, and, in their turn, destroy
many of the Saukies, which I judge to
be the reason that they increase no faster.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst I staid here, I took a view of
some mountains that lie about fifteen miles
to the southward, and abound in lead ore.
I ascended one of the highest of these, and
had an extensive view of the country. For
many miles nothing was to be seen but
lesser mountains, which appeared at a <a id='dist'></a>distance
like haycocks, they being free from
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span>trees. Only a few groves of hickery, and
stunted oaks, covered some of the vallies.
So plentiful is lead here, that I saw large
quantities of it lying about the streets in
the town belonging to the Saukies, and
it seemed to be as good as the produce of
other countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 10th of October we proceeded
down the river, and the next day reached
the first town of the Ottigaumies. This
town contained about fifty houses, but we
found most of them deserted, on account
of an epidemical disorder that had lately
raged among them, and carried off more
than one half of the inhabitants. The
greater part of those who survived had retired
into the woods, to avoid the contagion.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 15th we entered that extensive
river the Mississippi. The Ouisconsin,
from the Carrying Place to the part
where it falls into the Mississippi, flows
with a smooth but a strong current; the
water of it is exceedingly clear, and
through it you may perceive a fine and
sandy bottom, tolerably free from rocks.
In it are a few islands, the soil of which
appeared to be good, though somewhat
woody. The land near the river also
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span>seemed to be, in general, excellent; but
that at a distance is very full of mountains,
where it is said there are many lead
mines.</p>

<p class='c000'>About five miles from the junction of
the rivers, I observed the ruins of a large
town in a very pleasing situation. On
enquiring of the neighbouring Indians
why it was thus deserted, I was informed,
that about thirty years ago, the Great
Spirit had appeared on the top of a pyramid
of rocks, which lay at a little
distance from it, towards the west, and
warned them to quit their habitations;
for the land on which they were built
belonged to him, and he had occasion
for it. As a proof that he, who gave
them these orders, was really the Great
Spirit, he further told them, that the grass
should immediately spring up on those
very rocks from whence he now addressed
them, which they knew to be bare
and barren. The Indians obeyed, and
soon after discovered that this miraculous
alteration had taken place. They shewed
me the spot, but the growth of the grass
appeared to be no ways supernatural. I
apprehend this to have been a stratagem
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span>of the French or Spaniards to answer some
selfish view; but in what manner they
effected their purposes I know not.</p>

<p class='c000'>This people, soon after their removal,
built a town on the bank of the Mississippi,
near the mouth of the Ouisconsin, at a
place called by the French La Prairies les
Chiens, which signifies the Dog Plains;
it is a large town, and contains about
three hundred families; the houses are well
built after the Indian manner, and pleasantly
situated on a very rich soil, from
which they raise every necessary of life
in great abundance. I saw here many
horses of a good size and shape. This
town is the great mart, where all the adjacent
tribes, and even those who inhabit
the most remote branches of the
Mississippi, annually assemble about the
latter end of May, bringing with them
their furs to dispose of to the traders.
But it is not always that they conclude
their sale here; this is determined by a
general council of the chiefs, who consult
whether it would be more conducive
to their interest, to sell their goods at this
place, or carry them on to Louisiana, or
Michillimackinac. According to the decision
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span>of this council they either proceed
further, or return to their different
homes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mississippi, at the entrance of the
Ouisconsin, near which stands a mountain
of considerable height, is about half a
mile over; but opposite to the last mentioned
town it appears to be more than
a mile wide, and full of islands, the soil
of which is extraordinary rich, and but
thinly wooded.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little farther to the west, on the
contrary side, a small river falls into the
Mississippi, which the French call Le Jaun
Riviere, or the Yellow River. Here the
traders who had accompanied me hitherto,
took up their residence for the winter. I
then bought a canoe, and with two servants,
one a French Canadian and the
other a Mohawk of Canada, on the 19th
proceeded up the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c000'>About ten days after I had parted from
the traders, I landed as I usually did every
evening, and having pitched my tent, I
ordered my men, when night came on,
to lay themselves down to sleep. By a
light that I kept burning I then sat down
to copy the minutes I had taken in the
<span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span>course of the preceding day. About ten
o’clock, having just finished my memorandums,
I stepped out of my tent to
see what weather it was. As I cast my
eyes towards the bank of the river, I
thought I saw by the light of the stars
which shone bright, something that had
the appearance of a herd of beasts coming
down a descent at some distance; whilst
I was wondering what they could be, one
of the number suddenly sprung up and discovered
to me the form of a man. In an
instant they were all on their legs, and I
could count about ten or twelve of them
running towards me. I immediately re-entered
the tent, and awaking my men,
ordered them to take their arms, and follow
me. As my first apprehensions were
for my canoe, I ran to the water’s side,
and found a party of Indians (for such I
now discovered them to be) on the point
of plundering it. Before I reached them
I commanded my men not to fire till I
had given the word, being unwilling to
begin hostilities unless occasion absolutely
required. I accordingly advanced with
resolution, close to the points of their
spears, they had no other weapons, and
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span>brandishing my hanger, asked them with
a stern voice, what they wanted. They
were staggered at this, and perceiving
they were like to meet with a warm reception,
turned about and precipitately
retreated. We pursued them to an adjacent
wood, which they entered, and we
saw no more of them. However, for
fear of their return, we watched alternately
during the remainder of the night.
The next day my servants were under
great apprehensions, and earnestly entreated
me to return to the traders we
had lately left. But I told them, that if
they would not be esteemed old women
(a term of the greatest reproach among
the Indians) they must follow me; for I
was determined to pursue my intended
route, as an Englishman, when once engaged
in an adventure, never retreated.
On this they got into the canoe, and I
walked on the shore to guard them from
any further attack. The party of Indians
who had thus intended to plunder
me, I afterwards found to be some of
those straggling bands, that having been
driven from among the different tribes to
which they belonged for various crimes,
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span>now associated themselves together, and,
living by plunder, prove very troublesome
to travellers who pass this way; nor
are even Indians of every tribe spared by
them. The traders had before cautioned
me to be upon my guard against them,
and I would repeat the same caution to
those whose business might call them into
these parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the first of November I arrived
at Lake Pepin, which is rather an extended
part of the River Mississippi, that
the French have thus denominated, about
two hundred miles from the Ouisconsin.
The Mississippi below this Lake
flows with a gentle current, but the
breadth of it is very uncertain, in some
places it being upwards of a mile, in
others not more than a quarter. This
River has a range of mountains on each
side throughout the whole of the way;
which in particular parts approach near
to it, in others lie at a greater distance.
The land betwixt the mountains, and
on their sides, is generally covered with
grass with a few groves of trees interspersed,
near which large droves of deer
and elk are frequently seen feeding. In
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span>many places pyramids of rocks appeared,
resembling old ruinous towers; at others
amazing precipices; and what is very remarkable,
whilst this scene presented itself
on one side, the opposite side of the
same mountain was covered with the
finest herbage, which gradually ascended
to its summit. From thence the most
beautiful and extensive prospect that imagination
can form opens to your view.
Verdant plains, fruitful meadows, numerous
islands, and all these abounding with
a variety of trees that yield amazing
quantities of fruit, without care or cultivation,
such as the nut-tree, the maple
which produces sugar, vines loaded with
rich grapes, and plum-trees bending under
their blooming burdens, but above
all, the fine River flowing gently beneath,
and reaching as far as the eye can extend,
by turns attract your admiration and excite
your wonder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Lake is about twenty miles long
and near six in breadth; in some places
it is very deep, and abounds with various
kinds of fish. Great numbers of fowl
frequent also this Lake and rivers adjacent,
such as storks, swans, geese, brants, and
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span>ducks: and in the groves are found great
plenty of turkeys and partridges. On the
plains are the largest buffaloes of any in
America. Here I observed the ruins of a
French factory, where it is said Captain
St. Pierre resided, and carried on a very
great trade with the Naudowessies, before
the reduction of Canada.</p>

<p class='c000'>About sixty miles below this Lake is
a mountain remarkably situated; for it
stands by itself exactly in the middle of
the River, and looks as if it had slidden
from the adjacent shore into the stream.
It cannot be termed an island, as it rises
immediately from the brink of the water
to a considerable height. Both the Indians
and the French call it the Mountain
in the River.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day having landed on the shore of
the Mississippi, some miles below Lake
Pepin, whilst my attendants were preparing
my dinner, I walked out to take
a view of the adjacent country. I had
not proceeded far, before I came to a
fine, level, open plain, on which I perceived
at a little distance, a partial elevation
that had the appearance of an intrenchment.
On a nearer inspection I
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>had greater reason to suppose that it had
really been intended for this many centuries
ago. Notwithstanding it was now
covered with grass, I could plainly discern
that it had once been a breast-work
of about four feet in height, extending
the best part of a mile, and sufficiently capacious
to cover five thousand men. Its
form was somewhat circular, and its flanks
reached to the River. Though much defaced
by time, every angle was distinguishable,
and appeared as regular, and fashioned
with as much military skill, as if planned
by Vauban himself. The ditch was
not visible, but I thought on examining
more curiously, that I could perceive
there certainly had been one. From its
situation also, I am convinced that it
must have been designed for this purpose.
It fronted the country, and the rear was
covered by the River; nor was there any
rising ground for a considerable way that
commanded it; a few straggling oaks
were alone to be seen near it. In many
places small tracks were worn across it
by the feet of the elks and deer, and
from the depth of the bed of earth by
which it was covered, I was able to draw
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>certain conclusions of its great antiquity.
I examined all the angles and every part
with great attention, and have often
blamed myself since, for not encamping
on the spot, and drawing an exact plan of
it. To shew that this description is not
the offspring of a heated imagination, or
the chimerical tale of a mistaken traveller,
I find on enquiry since my return,
that Mons. St. Pierre and several traders
have, at different times, taken notice of
similar appearances, on which they have
formed the same conjectures, but without
examining them so minutely as I did.
How a work of this kind could exist in
a country that has hitherto (according to
the general received opinion) been the
seat of war to untutored Indians alone,
whose whole stock of military knowledge
has only, till within two centuries, amounted
to drawing the bow, and whose
only breast-work even at present is the
thicket, I know not. I have given as
exact an account as possible of this singular
appearance, and leave to future explorers
of these distant regions to discover
whether it is a production of nature
or art. Perhaps the hints I have
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span>here given might lead to a more perfect
investigation of it, and give us very different
ideas of the ancient state of realms
that we at present believe to have been
from the earliest period only the habitations
of savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mississippi, as far as the entrance
of the River St. Croix, thirty miles
above Lake Pepin, is very full of islands;
some of which are of a considerable
length. On these, also, grow great numbers
of the maple or sugar tree, and
around them vines loaded with grapes
creeping to their very tops. From the
Lake upwards few mountains are to be
seen, and those but small. Near the River
St. Croix reside three bands of the
Nawdowessie Indians, called the River
Bands.</p>

<p class='c000'>This nation is composed, at present,
of eleven bands. They were originally
twelve; but the Assinipoils some years
ago revolting, and separating themselves
from the others, there remain only at
this time eleven. Those I met here are
termed the River Bands; because they
chiefly dwell near the banks of this River:
the other eight are generally distinguished
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>by the title of the Naudowessies
of the Plains, and inhabit a country that
lies more to the westward. The names
of the former are the Nehogatawonahs,
the Mawtawbauntowahs, and the Shahsweentowahs,
and consist of about four
hundred warriors.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little before I met with these three
bands I fell in with a party of the Mawtawbauntowahs,
amounting to forty warriors
and their families. With these I
resided a day or two, during which time
five or six of their number, who had been
out on an excursion, returned in great
haste, and acquainted their companions
that a large party of the Chipéway warriors,
“enough,” as they expressed themselves,
“to swallow them all up,” were
close at their heels, and on the point of
attacking their little camp. The chiefs
applied to me, and desired I would put
myself at their head, and lead them out
to oppose their enemies. As I was a
stranger, and unwilling to excite the anger
of either nation, I knew not how to
act; and never found myself in a greater
dilemma. Had I refused to assist the
Naudowessies I should have drawn on
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span>myself their displeasure, or had I met
the Chipéways with hostile intentions, I
should have made that people my foes,
and had I been fortunate enough to have
escaped their arrows at this time, on some
future occasion should probably have experienced
the severity of their revenge. In
this extremity I chose the middle course,
and desired that the Naudowessies would
suffer me to meet them, that I might endeavour
to avert their fury. To this they
reluctantly assented, being persuaded, from
the inveteracy which had long prevailed
between them, that my remonstrances
would be in vain.</p>

<p class='c000'>Taking my Frenchman with me, who
could speak their language, I hastened
towards the place where the Chipéways
were supposed to be. The Naudowessies
during this kept at a distance behind. As
I approached them with the pipe of peace,
a small party of their chiefs, consisting
of about eight or ten, came in a friendly
manner towards me; with whom, by
means of my interpreter, I held a long
conversation; the result of which was,
that their rancour being by my persuasions
in some measure mollified, they
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span>agreed to return back without accomplishing
their savage purposes. During our discourse
I could perceive, as they lay scattered
about, that the party was very numerous,
and many of them armed with
muskets.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having happily succeeded in my undertaking,
I returned without delay to
the Naudowessies, and desired they would
instantly remove their camp to some other
part of the country, lest their enemies
should repent of the promise they had
given, and put their intentions in execution.
They accordingly followed my
advice, and immediately prepared to strike
their tents. Whilst they were doing this
they loaded me with thanks; and when
I had seen them on board their canoes I
pursued my route.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this adventure I was chiefly indebted
for the friendly reception I afterwards
met with from the Naudowessies of the
Plains, and for the respect and honours I
received during my abode among them.
And when I arrived many months after
at the Chipéway village, near the Ottowaw
lakes, I found that my fame had
reached that place before me. The chiefs
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span><a id='rec'></a>received me with great cordiality, and
the elder part of them thanked me for
the mischief I had prevented. They informed
me, that the war between their
nation and the Naudowessies had continued
without interruption for more than
forty winters. That they had long wished
to put an end to it, but this was generally
prevented by the young warriors of
either nation, who could not restrain their
ardour when they met. They said, they
should be happy if some chief of the
same pacific disposition as myself, and who
possessed an equal degree of resolution and
coolness, would settle in the country between
the two nations; for by the interference
of such a person an accommodation,
which on their parts they sincerely desired,
might be brought about. As I did
not meet any of the Naudowessies afterwards,
I had not an opportunity of forwarding
so good a work.</p>

<p class='c000'>About thirty miles below the Falls of
St. Anthony, at which I arrived the tenth
day after I <a id='left'></a>left Lake Pepin, is a remarkable
cave of an amazing depth. The
Indians term it Wakon-teebe, that is,
the Dwelling of the Great Spirit. The
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span>entrance into it is about ten feet wide,
the height of it five feet. The arch
within is near fifteen feet high and about
thirty feet broad. The bottom of it consists
of fine clear sand. About twenty
feet from the entrance begins a lake, the
water of which is transparent, and extends
to an unsearchable distance; for
the darkness of the cave prevents all attempts
to acquire a knowledge of it. I
threw a small pebble towards the interior
parts of it with my utmost strength: I
could hear that it fell into the water,
and notwithstanding it was of so small a
size, it caused an astonishing and horrible
noise that reverberated through all those
gloomy regions. I found in this cave
many Indian hieroglyphicks, which appeared
very ancient, for time had nearly
covered them with moss, so that it was
with difficulty I could trace them. They
were cut in a rude manner upon the inside
of the walls, which were composed
of a stone so extremely soft that it might
be easily penetrated with a knife: a
stone every where to be found near the
Mississippi. The cave is only accessible
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>by ascending a narrow, steep passage that
lies near the brink of the river.</p>

<p class='c000'>At a little distance from this dreary
cavern is the burying-place of several
bands of the Naudowessie Indians: though
these people have no fixed residence, living
in tents, and abiding but a few months
on one spot, yet they always bring the
bones of their dead to this place; which
they take the opportunity of doing when
the chiefs meet to hold their councils,
and to settle all public affairs for the ensuing
summer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ten miles below the Falls of St. Anthony
the River St. Pierre, called by the
natives the Waddapawmenesotor, falls into
the Mississippi from the west. It is not
mentioned by Father Hennipin, although
a large fair river: this omission, I conclude,
must have proceeded from a small
island that is situated exactly at its entrance,
by which the sight of it is intercepted.
I should not have discovered this
river myself, had I not taken a view,
when I was searching for it, from the
high lands opposite, which rise to a great
height.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span>Nearly over against this river I was
obliged to leave my canoe, on account of
the ice, and travel by land to the Falls
of St. Anthony, where I arrived on the
17th of November. The Mississippi from
the St. Pierre to this place is rather more
rapid than I had hitherto found it, and
without islands of any consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>Before I left my canoe I overtook a
young prince of the Winnebago Indians,
who was going on an embassy to some of
the bands of the Naudowessies. Finding
that I intended to take a view of the Falls,
he agreed to accompany me, his curiosity
having been often excited by the accounts
he had received from some of his chiefs:
he accordingly left his family (for the
Indians never travel without their households)
at this place, under the care of my
Mohawk servant, and we proceeded together
by land, attended only by my
Frenchman, to this celebrated place.</p>

<p class='c000'>We could distinctly hear the noise of
the water full fifteen miles before we
reached the Falls; and I was greatly pleased
and surprized, when I approached this
astonishing work of nature: but I was
not long at liberty to indulge these emotions,
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span>my attention being called off by the
behaviour of my companion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prince had no sooner gained the
point that overlooks this wonderful cascade,
than he began with an audible voice
to address the Great Spirit, one of whose
places of residence he imagined this to be.
He told him that he had come a long way
to pay his adorations to him, and now
would make him the best offerings in his
power. He accordingly first threw his
pipe into the stream; then the roll that
contained his tobacco; after these, the
bracelets he wore on his arms and wrists;
next an ornament that encircled his neck,
composed of beads and wires; and at last
the ear-rings from his ears; in short, he
presented to his god every part of his dress
that was valuable: during this he frequently
smote his breast with great violence,
threw his arms about, and appeared
to be much agitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>All this while he continued his adorations,
and at length concluded them with
fervent petitions that the Great Spirit would
constantly afford us his protection on our
travels, giving us a bright sun, a blue sky,
and clear untroubled waters: nor would he
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span>leave the place till we had smoaked together
with my pipe in honour of the
Great Spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>I was greatly surprized at beholding an
instance of such elevated devotion in so
young an Indian, and instead of ridiculing
the ceremonies attending it, as I observed
my catholic servant tacitly did, I
looked on the prince with a greater degree
of respect for these sincere proofs he gave
of his piety; and I doubt not but that
his offerings and prayers were as acceptable
to the universal Parent of mankind,
as if they had been made with greater
pomp, or in a consecrated place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Indeed, the whole conduct of this young
prince at once amazed and charmed me.
During the few days we were together his
attention seemed totally to be employed in
yielding me every assistance in his power;
and even in so short a time he gave me
innumerable proofs of the most generous
and disinterested friendship; so that on
our return I parted from him with great
reluctance. Whilst I beheld the artless,
yet engaging manners of this unpolished
savage, I could not help drawing a comparison
between him and some of the more
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>refined inhabitants of civilized countries,
not much, I own, in favour of the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Falls of St. Anthony received
their name from Father Louis Hennipin,
a French missionary, who travelled into
these parts about the year 1680, and was
the first European ever seen by the natives.
This amazing body of waters,
which are above 250 yards over, form a
most pleasing cataract; they fall perpendicularly
about thirty feet, and the rapids
below, in the space of 300 yards more,
render the descent considerably greater; so
that when viewed at a distance they appear
to be much higher than they really
are. The above-mentioned traveller has
laid them down at above sixty feet; but
he has made a greater error in calculating
the height of the Falls of Niagara; which
he asserts to be 600 feet; whereas from
latter observations accurately made, it is
well known that it does not exceed 140
feet. But the good father I fear too often
had no other foundation for his accounts
than report, or, at best, a slight
inspection.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the middle of the Falls stands a
small island, about forty feet broad and
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span>somewhat longer, on which grow a few
cragged hemlock and spruce trees; and
about half way between this island and
the eastern shore is a rock, lying at the
very edge of the Fall, in an oblique position,
that appeared to be about five or six
feet broad, and thirty or forty long. These
Falls vary much from all the others I have
seen, as you may approach close to them
without finding the least obstruction from
any intervening hill or precipice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country around them is extremely
beautiful. It is not an uninterrupted plain
where the eye finds no relief, but composed
of many gentle ascents, which in the
summer are covered with the finest verdure,
and interspersed with little groves,
that give a pleasing variety to the prospect.
On the whole, when the Falls are included,
which may be seen at the distance of
four miles, a more pleasing and picturesque
view cannot, I believe, be found throughout
the universe. I could have wished
that I had happened to enjoy this glorious
sight at a more seasonable time of the
year, whilst the trees and hillocks were
clad in nature’s gayest livery, as this must
have greatly added to the pleasure I received;
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span>however, even then it exceeded
my warmest expectations. I have endeavoured
to give the Reader as just an
idea of this enchanting spot as possible,
in the plan annexed; but all description,
whether of the pencil or the pen, must
fall infinitely short of the original.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>At a little distance below the Falls
stands a small island, of about an acre and
half, on which grow a great number of
oak trees, every branch of which, able to
support the weight, was full of eagles
nests. The reason that this kind of birds
resort in such numbers to this spot, is
that they are here secure from the attacks
either of man or beast, their retreat being
guarded by the Rapids, which the Indians
never attempt to pass. Another reason
is, that they find a constant supply of
food for themselves and their young, from
the animals and fish which are dashed to
pieces by the Falls, and driven on the adjacent
shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having satisfied my curiosity, as far as
the eye of man can be satisfied, I proceeded
on, still accompanied by my young
friend, till I had reached the River St.
Francis, near sixty miles above the Falls.
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>To this river Father Hennipin gave the
name of St. Francis, and this was the extent
of his travels, as well as mine, towards
the north-west. As the season was
so advanced, and the weather extremely
cold, I was not able to make so many observations
on these parts as I otherwise
should have done.</p>

<p class='c000'>It might however, perhaps, be necessary
to observe, that in the little tour I
made about the Falls, after travelling fourteen
miles, by the side of the Mississippi,
I came to a river nearly twenty yards
wide, which ran from the north-east,
called Rum River. And on the 20th of
November came to another termed Goose
River, about twelve yards wide. On the
21st I arrived at the St. Francis, which
is about thirty yards wide. Here the
Mississippi itself grows narrow, being not
more than ninety yards over; and appears
to be chiefly composed of small branches.
The ice prevented me from noticing the
depth of any of these three rivers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country in some places is hilly,
but without large mountains; and the land
is tolerably good. I observed here many
deer and carribboos, some elk, with abundance
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>of beavers, otters, and other furs.
A little above this, to the north-east, are
a number of small lakes called the Thousand
Lakes; the parts about which, though
but little frequented, are the best within
many miles for hunting, as the hunter
never fails of returning loaded beyond his
expectations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mississippi has never been explored
higher up than the River St. Francis, and
only by Father Hennipin and myself thus
far. So that we are obliged solely to
the Indians, for all the intelligence we
are able to give relative to the more northern
parts. As this River is not navigable
from the sea for vessels of any considerable
burthen, much higher up than the Forks
of the Ohio, and even that is accomplished
with great difficulty, owing to the rapidity
of the current, and the windings
of the river, those settlements that may
be made on the interior branches of it,
must be indisputably secure from the attacks
of any maritime power. But at
the same time the settlers will have the
advantage of being able to convey their
produce to the sea-ports with great facility,
the current of the river from its
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span>source to its entrance into the Gulph of
Mexico, being extremely favourable for
doing this in small craft. This might
also in time be facilitated by canals or
shorter cuts; and a communication opened
by water with New York, Canada, &amp;c.
by way of the lakes. The Forks of the
Ohio are about nine hundred miles from
the mouth of the Mississippi, following
the course of the river; and the Messorie
two hundred miles above these. From
the latter it is about twenty miles to the
Illinois River, and from that to the Ouisconsin,
which I have given an account of,
about eight hundred more.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 25th I returned to my canoe,
which I had left at the mouth of the
River St. Pierre; and here I parted with
regret from my young friend the prince
of the Winnebagoes. This river being
clear of ice by reason of its southern situation,
I found nothing to obstruct my
passage. On the 28th, being advanced
about forty miles, I arrived at a small
branch that fell into it from the north;
to which, as it had no name that I could
distinguish it by, I gave my own; and
the Reader will find it in the plan of my
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span>travels denominated Carver’s River. About
forty miles higher up I came to the Forks
of Verd and Red Marble Rivers, which
join at some little distance before they
enter the St. Pierre.</p>

<p class='c000'>The River St. Pierre, at its junction
with the Mississippi, is about a hundred
yards broad, and continues that breadth
nearly all the way I sailed upon it. It has
a great depth of water, and in some places
runs very briskly. About fifty miles from
its mouth are some rapids, and much
higher up there are many others.</p>

<p class='c000'>I proceeded up this river about two
hundred miles to the country of the Naudowessies
of the Plains, which lies a little
above the Forks formed by the Verd and
Red Marble Rivers, just mentioned, where
a branch from the south nearly joins the
Messorie River. By the accounts I received
from the Indians, I have reason to
believe that the River St. Pierre and the
Messorie, though they enter the Mississippi
twelve hundred miles from each
other, take their rise in the same neighbourhood;
and this within the space of a
mile. The River St. Pierre’s northern
branch rises from a number of lakes near
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>the shining mountains; and it is from
some of these, also, that a capital branch
of the River Bourbon, which runs into
Hudson’s Bay, has its sources.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the intelligence I gained from
the Naudowessie Indians, among whom I
arrived the 7th of December, and whose
language I perfectly acquired during a residence
of five months; and also from the
accounts I afterwards obtained from the
Assinipoils, who speak the same tongue,
being a revolted band of the Naudowessies;
and from the Killistinoes, neighbours
of the Assinipoils, who speak the
Chipéway language, and inhabit the heads
of the River Bourbon; I say from these
nations, together with my own observations,
I have learned that the four most
capital rivers on the Continent of North
America, viz. the St. Lawrence, the Mississippi,
the River Bourbon, and the Oregon
or the River of the West (as I hinted
in my Introduction) have their sources in
the same neighbourhood. The waters of
the three former are within thirty miles
of each other; the latter, however, is
rather farther west.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span>This shews that these parts are the
highest lands in North America; and it
is an instance not to be paralleled on the
other three quarters of the globe, that four
rivers of such magnitude should take their
rise together, and each, after running separate
courses, discharge their waters into
different oceans at the distance of two
thousand miles from their sources. For
in their passage from this spot to the bay
of St. Lawrence, east, to the bay of
Mexico, south, to Hudson’s Bay, north,
and to the bay at the Straights of Annian,
west, each of these traverse upwards of
two thousand miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall here give my Readers such reflections
as occurred to me, when I had
received this interesting information, and
had, by numberless inquiries, ascertained
the truth of it; that is, as far as it was
possible to arrive at a certainty without a
personal investigation.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is well known that the Colonies,
particularly those of New England and
Canada, are greatly affected, about the
time their winter sets in, by a north-west
wind, which continues for several months,
and renders the cold much more intense
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>there than it is in the interior parts of
America. This I can, from my own
knowledge, assert, as I found the winter,
that I passed to the westward of the Mississippi,
far from severe; and the north-west
wind blowing on those countries considerably
more temperate than I have often
experienced it to be nearer the coast.
And that this did not arise from an uncertainty
of the seasons, but was annually
the case, I conclude, both from the
small quantity of snow that then fell, and
a total disuse of snow shoes by these Indians,
without which none of the more
eastern nations can possibly travel during
the winter.</p>

<p class='c000'>As naturalists observe, that air resembles
water in many respects, particularly
by often flowing in a compact body; and
that this is generally remarked to be with
the current of large streams, and seldom
across them, may not the winds that set
violently into the Bay of Mexico about
the latter end of the year, take their course
over the continent in the same direction
as the Mississippi does; till meeting with
the north winds (that from a similar
cause blow up the Bourbon from Hudson’s
<span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span>Bay) they are forced across the great
lakes, down the current of the waters
of the St. Lawrence, and united, commit
those ravages, and occasion those severe
winters, experienced in the before-mentioned
countries? During their progress
over the lakes they become expanded,
and consequently affect a greater tract
of land than they otherwise would do.</p>

<p class='c000'>According to my scanty knowledge of
natural philosophy this does not appear
improbable. Whether it is agreeable to
the laws established by naturalists to account
for the operations of that element,
I know not. However, the description
here given of the situation of these vast
bodies of water, and their near approach
to each other, with my own undigested
suppositions of their effect on the winds,
may prove perhaps, in abler hands, the
means of leading to many useful discoveries.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the 7th of December, I arrived
(as I said before) at the utmost extent of
my travels towards the west; where I
met with a large party of the Naudowessie
Indians, among whom I resided seven
months. These constituted a part of the
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span>eight bands of the Naudowessies of the
Plains; and are termed the Wawpeentowahs,
the Tintons, the Asrahcootans,
the Mawhaws, and the Schians. The
other three bands, whose names are the
Schianese, the Chongousceton, and the
Waddapawjestin, dwell higher up, to
the west of the River St. Pierre, on plains
that, according to their account, are unbounded;
and probably terminate on the
coast of the Pacific Ocean. The Naudowessie
nation, when united, consists of
more than two thousand warriors. The
Assinipoils, who revolted from them,
amount to about three hundred; and
leagued with the Killistinoes, live in a
continual state of enmity with the other
eleven bands.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I proceeded up the River St. Pierre,
and had nearly reached the place where
these people were encamped, I observed
two or three canoes coming down the
stream; but no sooner had the Indians
that were on board them discovered us,
than they rowed toward the land, and
leaping ashore with precipitation, left
their canoes to float as the current drove
them. In a few minutes I perceived
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>some others; who, as soon as they came
in sight, followed, with equal speed, the
example of their countrymen.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now thought it necessary to proceed
with caution; and therefore kept on the
side of the river opposite to that on
which the Indians had landed. However,
I still continued my course, satisfied
that the pipe of Peace which was
fixed at the head of my canoe, and the
English colours that were flying at the
stern, would prove my security. After
rowing about half a mile farther, in turning
a point, I discovered a great number
of tents, and more than a thousand Indians,
at a little distance from the shore.
Being now nearly opposite to them, I ordered
my men to pull directly over, as I
was willing to convince the Indians by
such a step, that I placed some confidence
in them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as I had reached the land, two
of the chiefs presented their hands to me,
and led me, amidst the astonished multitude,
who had most of them never seen
a white man before, to a tent. Into this
we entered, and according to the custom
that universally prevails among every Indian
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span>nation, began to smoke the pipe of
Peace. We had not sat long before the
crowd became so great, both around, and
upon the tent, that we were in danger of
being crushed by its fall. On this we
returned to the plain, where, having gratified
the curiosity of the common people,
their wonder abated, and ever after they
treated me with great respect.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the chiefs I met with the most
friendly and hospitable reception; which
induced me, as the season was so far advanced,
to take up my residence among
them during the winter. To render my
stay as comfortable as possible, I first endeavoured
to learn their language. This I soon
did, so as to make myself perfectly intelligible,
having before acquired some slight
knowledge of the language of those Indians
that live on the back of the settlements;
and in consequence met with every accommodation
their manner of living would afford.
Nor did I want for such amusements
as tended to make so long a period
pass cheerfully away. I frequently hunted
with them; and at other times beheld with
pleasure their recreations and pastimes,
which I shall describe hereafter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>Sometimes I sat with the chiefs, and
whilst we smoked the friendly pipe, entertained
them, in return for the accounts
they gave me of their wars and excursions,
with a narrative of my own adventures
and a description of all the battles fought
between the English and the French in
America, in many of which I had a personal
share. They always paid great attention
to my details, and asked many pertinent
questions relative to the European
methods of making war.</p>

<p class='c000'>I held these conversations with them in
a great measure to procure from them
some information relative to the chief
point I had constantly in view, that of
gaining a knowledge of the situation and
produce, both of their own country, and
those that lay to the westward of them.
Nor was I disappointed in my designs;
for I procured from them much useful
intelligence. They likewise drew for me
plans of all the countries with which
they were acquainted; but as I entertained
no great opinion of their geographical
knowledge, I placed not much dependence
on them, and therefore think it
unnecessary to give them to the public.
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>Such as I afterwards found confirmed, by
other accounts, or by my own observations,
make a part of the map prefixed to
this work. They draw with a piece of
burnt coal, taken from the hearth, upon
the inside bark of the birch tree; which is
as smooth as paper, and answers the same
purposes, notwithstanding it is of a yellow
cast. Their sketches are made in a
rude manner, but they seem to give as just
an idea of a country, although the plan is
not so exact, as more experienced draughtsmen
could do.</p>

<p class='c000'>I left the habitations of these hospitable
Indians the latter end of April 1767;
but did not part from them for several
days, as I was accompanied on my journey
by near three hundred of them, among
whom were many chiefs, to the mouth
of the River St. Pierre. At this season,
these bands annually go to the Great Cave,
before mentioned, to hold a grand council
with all the other bands; wherein
they settle their operations for the ensuing
year. At the same time they carry with
them their dead for interment bound up in
buffaloes skins. Besides those that accompanied
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>me, others were gone before, and
the rest were to follow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Never did I travel with so cheerful and
happy a company. But their mirth met
with a hidden and temporary allay from a
violent storm that overtook us one day
on our passage. We had just landed, and
were preparing to set up our tents for the
night, when a heavy cloud overspread the
heavens, and the most dreadful thunder,
lightning, and rain issued from it, that
ever I beheld.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians were greatly terrified, and
ran to such shelter as they could find;
for only a few tents were as yet erected.
Apprehensive of the danger that might
ensue from standing near any thing which
could serve for a conductor, as the cloud
appeared to contain such an uncommon
quantity of the electrical fluid, I took my
stand as far as possible from any covering;
chusing rather to be exposed to the peltings
of the storm than to receive a fatal
stroke. At this the Indians were greatly
surprized, and drew conclusions from it
not unfavourable to the opinion they already
entertained of my resolution. Yet
I acknowledge that I was never more
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span>affected in my life; for nothing scarcely
could exceed the terrific scene. The
peals of thunder were so loud that they
shook the earth; and the lightning flashed
along the ground in streams of sulphur;
so that the Indian chiefs themselves, although
their courage in war is usually invincible,
could not help trembling at the
horrid combustion. As soon as the storm
was over, they flocked around me, and
informed me, that it was a proof of the
anger of the evil spirits, whom they were
apprehensive that they had highly offended.</p>

<p class='c000'>When we arrived at the Great Cave,
and the Indians had deposited the remains
of their deceased friends in the
burial-place that stands adjacent to it,
they held their great council, into which
I was admitted, and at the same time had
the honour to be installed or adopted a
chief of their bands. On this occasion
I made the following speech, which I insert
to give my Readers a specimen of
the language and manner in which it is
necessary to address the Indians, so as to
engage their attention, and to render the
speaker’s expressions consonant to their
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span>ideas. It was delivered on the first day of
May 1767.</p>

<p class='c000'>“My brothers, chiefs of the numerous
and powerful Naudowessies! I rejoice
that through my long abode with
you, I can now speak to you (though
after an imperfect manner) in your
own tongue, like one of your own
children. I rejoice also that I have
had an opportunity so frequently to inform
you of the glory and power of
the Great King that reigns over the
English and other nations; who is descended
from a very ancient race of
sovereigns, as old as the earth and waters;
whose feet stand on two great
islands, larger than any you have ever
seen, amidst the greatest waters in the
world; whose head reaches to the sun,
and whose arms encircle the whole
earth. The number of whose warriors
are equal to the trees in the vallies,
the stalks of rice in yonder marshes,
or the blades of grass on your great
plains. Who has hundreds of canoes of
his own, of such amazing bigness, that
all the waters in your country would
not suffice for one of them to swim
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span>in; each of which have guns, not
small like mine which you see before
you, but of such magnitude, that a
hundred of your stoutest young men
would with difficulty be able to carry
one. And these are equally surprizing
in their operation against the great
king’s enemies when engaged in battle;
the terror they carry with them your
language wants words to express. You
may remember the other day when we
were encamping at Wadawpawmenesoter,
the black clouds, the wind, the
fire, the stupendous noise, the horrible
cracks, and the trembling of the earth
which then alarmed you, and gave you
reason to think your gods were angry
with you; not unlike these are the warlike
implements of the English when
they are fighting the battles of their
great King.</p>

<p class='c000'>“Several of the chiefs of your bands
have often told me, in times past,
when I dwelt with you in your tents,
that they much wished to be counted
among the children and allies of the
great King my master. You may remember
how often you have desired
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span>me, when I return again to my own
country, to acquaint the great King
of your good disposition towards him
and his subjects, and that you wished
for traders from the English to come
among you. Being now about to take
my leave of you, and to return to my
own country, a long way towards
the rising sun, I again ask you to tell
me whether you continue of the same
mind as when I spoke to you in council
last winter; and as there are now
several of your chiefs here, who came
from the great plains towards the setting
of the sun, whom I have never
spoke with in council before, I ask you
to let me know if you are all willing
to acknowledge yourselves the children
of my great master the King of
the English and other nations, as I
shall take the first opportunity to acquaint
him of your desires and good
intentions. I charge you not to give
heed to bad reports; for there are
wicked birds flying about among the
neighbouring nations, who may whisper
evil things in your ears against the
English, contrary to what I have told
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>you; you must not believe them, for I
have told you the truth.</p>

<p class='c000'>“And as for the chiefs that are about
to go to Michillimackinac, I shall take
care to make for them and their suite,
a straight road, smooth waters, and a
clear sky; that they may go there,
and smoke the pipe of Peace, and rest
secure on a beaver blanket under the
shade of the great tree of peace. Farewell!”</p>

<p class='c000'>To this speech I received the following
answer, from the mouth of the principal
chief:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Good brother! I am now about to
speak to you with the mouths of these
my brothers, chiefs of the eight bands
of the powerful nation of the Naudowessies.
We believe and are well
satisfied in the truth of every thing
you have told us about your great nation,
and the Great King our greatest
father; for whom we spread this beaver
blanket, that his fatherly protection
may ever rest easy and safe amongst us
his children: your colours and your
arms agree with the accounts you have
given us about your great nation. We
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>desire that when you return, you will
acquaint the Great King how much the
Naudowessies wish to be counted among
his good children. You may believe
us when we tell you that we will not
open our ears to any who may dare to
speak evil of our Great Father the King
of the English and other nations.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We thank you for what you have
done for us in making peace between
the Naudowessies and the Chipéways,
and hope when you return to us again,
that you will complete this good work;
and quite dispelling the clouds that intervene,
open the blue sky of peace,
and cause the bloody hatchet to be deep
buried under the roots of the great tree
of peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>“We wish you to remember to represent
to our Great Father, how much
we desire that traders may be sent to
abide among us, with such things as
we need, that the hearts of our young
men, our wives, and children may be
made glad. And may peace subsist between
us, so long as the sun, the moon,
the earth, and the waters shall endure.
Farewell.”</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>I thought it necessary to caution the
Indians against giving heed to any bad
reports that may reach them from the
neighbouring nations to the disadvantage
of the English, as I had heard, at different
places through which I passed, that emissaries
were still employed by the French
to detach those who were friendly to the
English from their interest. And I saw,
myself, several belts of Wampum that
had been delivered for this purpose to
some of the tribes I was among. On the
delivery of each of these a Talk was held,
wherein the Indians were told that the
English, who were but a petty people,
had stolen that country from their Great
Father the king of France whilst he was
asleep; but that he would soon awake,
and take them again under his protection.
These I found were sent from Canada by
persons who appeared to be well affected
towards the government under which they
lived.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst I tarried at the mouth of the
River St. Pierre with these friendly Indians,
I endeavoured to gain intelligence
whether any goods had been sent towards
the Falls of St. Anthony for my use, agreeable
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>to the promise I had received from
the governor when I left Michillimackinac.
But finding from some Indians,
who passed by in their return from those
parts, that this agreement had not been
fulfilled, I was obliged to give up all
thoughts of proceeding farther to the
north-west by this route, according to my
original plan. I therefore returned to La
Prairie le Chien, where I procured as many
goods from the traders I left there the
preceding year as they could spare.</p>

<p class='c000'>As these however were not sufficient to
enable me to renew my first design, I determined
to endeavour to make my way
across the country of the Chipéways to
Lake Superior; in hopes of meeting at
the Grand Portage on the north side of it,
the traders that annually go from Michillimackinac
to the north-west; of whom I
doubted not but that I should be able to
procure goods enough to answer my purpose,
and also to penetrate through those
more northern parts to the Straights of
Annian.</p>

<p class='c000'>And I the more readily returned to
La Prairie le Chien, as I could by that
means the better fulfil the engagement I
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>had made to the party of Naudowessies
mentioned at the conclusion of my speech.
During my abode with this people, wishing
to secure them entirely in the interest
of the English, I had advised some of the
chiefs to go to Michillimackinac, where
they would have an opportunity of trading,
and of hearing the accounts that I had
entertained them with of my countrymen
confirmed. At the same time I had furnished
them with a recommendation to the
governor, and given them every direction
necessary for their voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>In consequence of this one of the principal
chiefs, and twenty-five of an inferior
rank, agreed to go the ensuing summer.
This they took an opportunity of doing
when they came with the rest of their
band to attend the grand council at the
mouth of the River St. Pierre. Being
obliged, on account of the disappointment
I had just been informed of, to return so
far down the Mississippi, I could from
thence the more easily set them on their
journey.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the intermediate parts of this river
are much frequented by the Chipéways,
with whom the Naudowessies are continually
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span>at war, they thought it more prudent,
being but a small party, to take the
advantage of the night, than to travel with
me by day; accordingly no sooner was the
grand council broke up, than I took a
friendly leave of these people, from whom
I had received innumerable civilities, and
pursued once more my voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>I reached the eastern side of Lake Pepin
the same night, where I went ashore
and encamped as usual. The next morning,
when I had proceeded some miles
farther, I perceived at a distance before
me a smoke, which denoted that some Indians
were near; and in a short time discovered
ten or twelve tents not far from
the bank of the river. As I was apprehensive
that this was a party of the
Rovers I had before met with, I knew
not what course to pursue. My attendants
persuaded me to endeavour to pass by
them on the opposite side of the river;
but as I had hitherto found that the best
way to ensure a friendly reception from
the Indians is to meet them boldly, and
without shewing any tokens of fear, I
would by no means consent to their proposal.
Instead of this I crossed directly
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>over, and landed in the midst of them, for
by this time the greatest part of them were
standing on the shore.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first I accosted were <a id='chip2'></a>Chipéways
inhabiting near the Ottowaw lakes; who
received me with great cordiality, and
shook me by the hand in token of friendship.
At some little distance behind these
stood a chief remarkably tall and well
made, but of so stern an aspect that the
most undaunted person could not behold
him without feeling some degree of terror.
He seemed to have passed the meridian of
life, and by the mode in which he was
painted and tatowed, I discovered that he
was of high rank. However, I approached
him in a courteous manner, and expected
to have met with the same reception I had
done from the others: but to my great
surprize he with-held his hand, and looking
fiercely at me, said in the Chipéway
tongue, “Cawin nishishin saganosh,”
that is, “The English are no good.” As
he had his tomahawk in his hand, I expected
that this laconick sentence would
have been followed by a blow; to prevent
which I drew a pistol from my belt,
and, holding it in a careless position,
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span>passed close by him, to let him see I was
not afraid of him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I learned soon after from the other Indians,
that this was a chief, called by the
French the Grand Sautor, or the Great
Chipéway Chief, for they denominate the
Chipéways Sautors. They likewise told
me that he had been always a steady
friend to that people, and when they delivered
up Michillimackinac to the English
on their evacuation of Canada, the Grand
Sautor had sworn that he would ever remain
the avowed enemy of its new possessors,
as the territories on which the fort is
built belonged to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Finding him thus disposed, I took care
to be constantly upon my guard whilst
I staid; but that he might not suppose I
was driven away by his frowns, I took
up my abode there for the night. I pitched
my tent at some distance from the Indians,
and had no sooner laid myself
down to rest, than I was awakened by my
French servant. Having been alarmed by
the sound of Indian music, he had run
to the outside of the tent, where he beheld
a party of the young savages dancing
towards us in an extraordinary manner,
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>each carrying in his hand a torch fixed on
the top of a long pole. But I shall defer
any further account of this uncommon
entertainment, which at once surprized
and alarmed me, till I treat of the
Indian dances.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next morning I continued my voyage,
and before night reached La Prairie
le Chien; at which place the party of
Naudowessies soon overtook me. Not
long after the Grand Sautor also arrived,
and before the Naudowessies left that place
to continue their journey to Michillimackinac,
he found means, in conjunction
with some French traders from Louisiana,
to draw from me about ten of the Naudowessie
chiefs, whom he prevailed upon
to go towards those parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>The remainder proceeded, according to
my directions, to the English fort; from
whence I afterwards heard that they returned
to their own country without any
unfortunate accident befalling them, and
greatly pleased with the reception they
had met with. Whilst not more than
half of those who went to the southward,
through the difference of that southern
climate from their own, lived to reach
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span>their abode. And since I came to England
I have been informed, that the Grand
Sautor having rendered himself more and
more disgustful to the English by his inveterate
enmity towards them, was at
length stabbed in his tent, as he encamped
near Michillimackinac, by a trader to
whom I had related the foregoing story.</p>

<p class='c000'>I should have remarked, that whatever
Indians happen to meet at La Prairie le
Chien, the great mart to which all who inhabit
the adjacent countries resort, though
the nations to which they belong are at
war with each other, yet they are obliged
to restrain their enmity, and to forbear
all hostile acts during their stay there.
This regulation has been long established
among them for their mutual convenience,
as without it no trade could be
carried on. The same rule is observed
also at the Red Mountain (afterwards described)
from whence they get the stone
of which they make their pipes: these being
indispensable to the accommodation
of every neighbouring tribe, a similar restriction
becomes needful, and is of public
utility.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span>The River St. Pierre, which runs
through the territories of the Naudowessies,
flows through a most delightful country,
abounding with all the necessaries of
life, that grow spontaneously; and with
a little cultivation it might be made to
produce even the luxuries of life. Wild
rice grows here in great abundance; and
every part is filled with trees bending under
their loads of fruits, such as plums,
grapes, and apples; the meadows are covered
with hops, and many sorts of vegetables;
whilst the ground is stored with
useful roots, with angelica, spikenard, and
ground-nuts as large as hens eggs. At a
little distance from the sides of the river
are eminences, from which you have views
that cannot be exceeded even by the most
beautiful of those I have already described;
amidst these are delightful groves, and such
amazing quantities of maples, that they
would produce sugar sufficient for any
number of inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little way from the mouth of this
river, on the north side of it, stands a
hill, one part of which, that towards the
Mississippi, is composed entirely of white
stone, of the same soft nature as that I
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span>have before described; for such, indeed, is
all the stone in this country. But what
appears remarkable is, that the colour of it
is as white as the driven snow. The outward
part of it was crumbled by the wind
and weather into heaps of sand, of which
a beautiful composition might be made;
or, I am of opinion that, when properly
treated, the stone itself would grow harder
by time, and have a very noble effect in
architecture.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near that branch which is termed the
Marble River, is a mountain, from whence
the Indians get a sort of red stone, out of
which they hew the bowls of their pipes.
In some of these parts is found a black hard
clay, or rather stone, of which the Naudowessies
make their family utensils. This
country likewise abounds with a milk-white
clay, of which China ware might be
made equal in goodness to the Asiatic;
and also with a blue clay that serves the
Indians for paint; with this last they contrive,
by mixing it with the red stone powdered,
to paint themselves of different colours.
Those that can get the blue clay
here mentioned, paint themselves very
much with it; particularly when they are
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span>about to begin their sports and pastimes.
It is also esteemed by them a mark of
peace, as it has a resemblance of a blue
sky, which with them is a symbol of it,
and made use of in their speeches as a
figurative expression to denote peace. When
they wish to shew that their inclinations
are pacific towards other tribes, they greatly
ornament both themselves and their
belts with it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having concluded my business at La
Prairie le Chien, I proceeded once more
up the Mississippi as far as the place
where the Chipéway River enters it a
little below Lake Pepin. Here, having
engaged an Indian pilot, I directed him
to steer towards the Ottawaw Lakes which
lie near the head of this river. This he
did, and I arrived at them the beginning
of July.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chipéway River, at its junction
with the Mississippi, is about eighty yards
wide, but is much wider as you advance
into it. Near thirty miles up it
separates into two branches, and I took
my course through that which lies to the
eastward.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span>The country adjoining to the river, for
about sixty miles, is very level, and on its
banks lie fine meadows, where larger
droves of buffaloes and elks were feeding,
than I had observed in any other part of
my travels. The track between the two
branches of this river is termed the Road
of War between the Chipéway and Naudowessie
Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country to the Falls marked in
the plan at the extent of the traders travels,
is almost without any timber, and
above that very uneven and rugged, and
closely wooded with pines, beech, maple,
and birch. Here a most remarkable and
astonishing sight presented itself to my
view. In a wood, on the east of the
river, which was about three quarters
of a mile in length, and in depth farther
than my eye could reach, I observed
that every tree, many of which were
more than six feet in circumference, was
lying flat on the ground torn up by
the roots. This appeared to have been
done by some extraordinary hurricane
that came from the west some years ago,
but how many I could not learn, as I
found no inhabitants near it, of whom I
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span>could gain information. The country on
the west side of the river, from being less
woody, had escaped in a great measure this
havock, as only a few trees were blown
down.</p>

<p class='c000'>Near the heads of this river is a town
of the Chipéways, from whence it takes
its name. It is situated on each side of
the river (which at this place is of no considerable
breadth) and lies adjacent to the
banks of a small lake. This town contains
about forty houses, and can send out
upwards of one hundred warriors, many
of whom were fine stout young men. The
houses of it are built after the Indian manner,
and have neat plantations behind them;
but the inhabitants, in general, seemed
to be the nastiest people I had ever been
among. I observed that the women and
children indulged themselves in a custom,
which though common, in some degree,
throughout every Indian nation, appears
to be, according to our ideas, of the most
nauseous and indelicate nature; that of
searching each other’s head, and eating the
prey caught therein.</p>

<p class='c000'>In July I left this town, and having
crossed a number of small lakes and carrying
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span>places that intervened, came to a
head branch of the River St. Croix. This
branch I descended to a fork, and then
ascended another to its source. On both
these rivers I discovered several mines of
virgin copper, which was as pure as that
found in any other country.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here I came to a small brook, which
my guide thought might be joined at some
distance by streams that would at length
render it navigable. The water at first
was so scanty, that my canoe would by
no means swim in it; but having stopped
up several old beaver dams which had been
broken down by the hunters, I was enabled
to proceed for some miles, till by the
conjunction of a few brooks, these aids
became no longer necessary. In a short
time the water increased to a most rapid
river, which we descended till it entered
into Lake Superior. This river I named
after a gentleman that desired to accompany
me from the town of the Ottagaumies to
the Carrying Place on Lake Superior, Goddard’s
River.</p>

<p class='c000'>To the west of this is another small
river, which also empties itself into the
Lake. This I termed Strawberry River,
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span>from the great number of strawberries of
a good size and fine flavour that grew on
its banks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country from the Ottawaw Lakes
to Lake Superior is in general very uneven
and thickly covered with woods.
The soil in some places tolerably good,
in others but indifferent. In the heads of
the St. Croix and the Chipéway Rivers
are exceeding fine sturgeon. All the wilderness
between the Mississippi and Lake
Superior is called by the Indians the Moschettoe
country, and I thought it most
justly named; for, it being then their
season, I never saw or felt so many of
those insects in my life.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latter end of July I arrived, after
having coasted through West Bay, at the
Grand Portage, which lies on the north-west
borders of Lake Superior. Here
those who go on the north-west trade,
to the Lakes De Pluye, Dubois, &amp;c.
carry over their canoes and baggage about
nine miles, till they come to a number
of small lakes, the waters of some
of which descend into Lake Superior, and
others into the River Bourbon. Lake Superior
from West Bay to this place is
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span>bounded by rocks, except towards the
south-west part of the Bay where I first
entered it, there it was tolerably level.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the Grand Portage is a small bay,
before the entrance of which lies an island
that intercepts the dreary and uninterrupted
view over the Lake which otherwise
would have presented itself, and
makes the bay serene and pleasant. Here
I met a large party of the Killistinoe and
Assinipoil Indians, with their respective
kings and their families. They were
come to this place in order to meet the
traders from Michillimackinac, who make
this their road to the north-west. From
them I received the following account of
the Lakes that lie to the north-west of
Lake Superior.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake Bourbon, the most northern of
those yet discovered, received its name
from some French traders who accompanied
a party of Indians to Hudson’s Bay
some years ago; and was thus denominated
by them in honour of the royal family
of France. It is composed of the
waters of the Bourbon River, which, as
I have before observed, rises a great way
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span>to the southward, not far from the northern
heads of the Mississippi.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Lake is about eighty miles in
length, north and south, and is nearly circular.
It has no very large islands on it.
The land on the eastern side is very good;
and to the south-west there are some
mountains: in many other parts there are
barren plains, bogs, and morasses. Its latitude
is between fifty-two and fifty-four
degrees north, and it lies nearly south-west
from Hudson’s Bay. As through
its northern situation the weather there is
extremely cold, only a few animals are
to be found in the country that borders
on it. They gave me but an indifferent
account either of the beasts, birds, or fishes.
There are indeed some buffaloes of a small
size, which are fat and good about the
latter end of summer, with a few moose
and carribboo deer; however this deficiency
is made up by the furs of every
sort that are to be met with in great plenty
around the Lake. The timber growing
here is chiefly fir, cedar, spruce, and some
maple.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake Winnepeek, or as the French
write it Lac Ouinipique, which lies nearest
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>to the foregoing, is composed of the
same waters. It is in length about two
hundred miles north and south; its breadth
has never been properly ascertained, but
is supposed to be about one hundred
miles in its widest part. This Lake is
very full of islands; these are, however,
of no great magnitude. Many considerable
rivers empty themselves into it,
which, as yet, are not distinguished by
any names. The waters are stored with
fish, such as trout and sturgeon, and also
with others of a smaller kind peculiar to
these Lakes.</p>

<p class='c000'>The land on the south-west part of it is
very good, especially about the entrance
of a large branch of the River Bourbon
which slows from the south-west. On this
River there is a factory that was built
by the French called Fort La Reine, to
which the traders from Michillimackinac
resort to trade with the Assinipoils and
Killistinoes. To this place the Mahahs,
who inhabit a country two hundred and
fifty miles south-west, come also to trade
with them; and bring great quantities of
Indian corn to exchange for knives, tomahawks,
and other articles. These people are
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>supposed to dwell on some of the branches
of the River of the West.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake Winnepeek has on the north-east
some mountains, and on the east many
barren plains. The maple or sugar tree
grows here in great plenty, and there is
likewise gathered an amazing quantity of
rice, which proves that grain will flourish
in these northern climates as well as in
warmer. Buffaloes, carribboo, and moose
deer, are numerous in these parts. The
buffaloes of this country differ from those
that are found more to the south only
in size; the former being much smaller:
just as the black cattle of the northern
parts of Great Britain differ from English
oxen.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the waters that fall into this Lake,
the neighbouring nations take great numbers
of excellent furs. Some of these
they carry to the factories and settlements
belonging to the Hudson’s Bay
Company, situated above the entrance of
the Bourbon River: but this they do
with reluctance on several accounts; for
some of the Assinipoils and Killistinoes,
who usually traded with the Company’s
servants, told me, that if they could be
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>sure of a constant supply of goods from
Michillimackinac, they would not trade
any where else. They shewed me some
cloth and other articles that they had
purchased at Hudson’s Bay, with which
they were much dissatisfied, thinking they
had been greatly imposed upon in the
barter.</p>

<p class='c000'>Allowing that their accounts were
true, I could not help joining in their
opinion. But this dissatisfaction might
probably proceed, in a great measure,
from the intrigues of the Canadian traders:
for whilst the French were in possession
of Michillimackinac, having acquired
a thorough knowledge of the trade
of the north-west countries, they were
employed on that account, after the reduction
of Canada, by the English traders
there, in the establishment of this
trade with which they were themselves
quite unacquainted. One of the methods
they took to withdraw these Indians from
their attachment to the Hudson’s Bay
Company, and to engage their good opinion
in behalf of their new employers,
was by depreciating on all occasions the
Company’s goods, and magnifying the
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>advantages that would arise to them from
trafficking entirely with the Canadian
traders. In this they too well succeeded,
and from this, doubtless, did the dissatisfaction
the Assinipoils and Killistinoes
expressed to me, partly proceed. But
another reason augmented it; and this
was the length of their journey to the
Hudson’s Bay factories, which, they informed
me, took them up three months
during the summer heats to go and return,
and from the smallness of their canoes
they could not carry more than a
third of the beavers they killed. So that
it is not to be wondered at, that these
Indians should wish to have traders come
to reside among them. It is true that
the parts they inhabit are within the limits
of the Hudson’s Bay territories, but
the Company must be under the necessity
of winking at an encroachment of
this kind, as the Indians would without
doubt protect the traders when among
them. Besides, the passports granted to the
traders that go from Michillimackinac give
them liberty to trade to the north-west
about Lake Superior; by which is meant
Fort La Reine, Lake Winnepeek, or any
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span>other parts of the waters of the Bourbon
River, where the Couriers de Bois, or
Traders, may make it most convenient to
reside.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lac du Bois, as it is commonly termed
by the French in their maps, or in English
the Lake of the Wood, is so called
from the multiplicity of wood growing
on its banks; such as oaks, pines, firs,
spruce, &amp;c. This Lake lies still higher
up a branch of the River Bourbon, and
nearly east from the south end of Lake
Winnepeek. It is of great depth in some
places. Its length from east to west about
seventy miles, and its greatest breadth
about forty miles. It has but few islands,
and these of no great magnitude. The
fishes, fowls, and quadrupeds that are
found near it, vary but little from those
of the other two lakes. A few of the
Killistinoe Indians sometimes encamp on
the borders of it to fish and hunt.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Lake lies in the communication
between Lake Superior, and the Lakes
Winnepeek and Bourbon. Its waters are
not esteemed quite so pure as those of the
other lakes, it having, in many places, a
muddy bottom.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span>Lac La Pluye, so called by the French,
in English the Rainy Lake, is supposed
to have acquired this name from the first
travellers, that passed over it, meeting
with an uncommon deal of rain; or, as
some have affirmed, from a mist like rain
occasioned by a perpendicular water-fall
that empties itself into a river which lies
to the south-west.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Lake appears to be divided by an
isthmus, near the middle, into two parts:
the west part is called the Great Rainy
Lake, the east, the Little Rainy Lake,
as being the least division. It lies a few
miles farther to the eastward, on the same
branch of the Bourbon, than the last-mentioned
Lake. It is in general very
shallow in its depth. The broadest part
of it is not more than twenty miles, its
length, including both, about three hundred
miles. In the west part the water
is very clear and good; and some excellent
fish are taken in it. A great many fowl
resort here at the fall of the year. Moose
deer are to be found in great plenty, and
likewise the carribboo; whose skin for
breeches or gloves exceeds by far any
other to be met with in North-America.
<span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span>The land on the borders of this Lake is
esteemed in some places very good, but
rather too thickly covered with wood.
Here reside a considerable band of the Chipéways.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eastward from this Lake lie several
small ones, which extend in a string to
the great carrying place, and from thence
into Lake Superior. Between these little
Lakes are several carrying places, which
renders the trade to the north-west difficult
to accomplish, and exceedingly tedious,
as it takes two years to make one
voyage from Michillimackinac to these
parts.</p>

<p class='c000'>Red Lake is a comparatively small
lake at the head of a branch of the
Bourbon River, which is called by some
Red River. Its form is nearly round,
and about sixty miles in circumference.
On one side of it is a tolerable large
island, close by which a small river enters.
It bears almost south-east both from
Lake Winnepeek and from Lake du Bois.
The parts adjacent are very little known,
or frequented, even by the savages themselves.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span>Not far from this Lake, a little to the
south-west, is another called White Bear
Lake, which is nearly about the size of
the last mentioned. The waters that compose
this Lake are the most northern of
any that supply the Mississippi, and may
be called with propriety its most remote
source. It is fed by two or three small
rivers or rather large brooks.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few miles from it, to the south-east,
are a great number of small lakes, none
of which are more than ten miles in circumference,
that are called the Thousand
Lakes. In the adjacent country is reckoned
the finest hunting for furs of any
on this continent; the Indians who hunt
here seldom returning without having
their canoes loaded as deep as they can
swim.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having just before observed that this
Lake is the utmost northern source of
the Mississippi, I shall here further remark,
that before this river enters the
Gulph of Mexico, it has not run less,
through all its meanderings, than three
thousand miles; or, in a strait line from
north to south, about twenty degrees,
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>which is nearly fourteen hundred English
miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Indians informed me, that to
the north-west of Lake Winnepeek lies
another, whose circumference vastly exceeded
any they had given me an account
of. They describe it as much larger than
Lake Superior. But as it appears to be
so far to the north-west, I should imagine
that it was not a lake, but rather the
Archipelago or broken waters that form
the communication between Hudson’s Bay
and the northern parts of the Pacific
Ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are an infinite number of small
lakes, on the more western parts of the
western head-branches of the Mississippi,
as well as between these and Lake Winnepeek,
but none of them are large enough
to suppose either of them to be the lake
or waters meant by the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>They likewise informed me, that some
of the northern branches of the Messorie
and the southern branches of the St. Pierre
have a communication with each other,
except for a mile; over which they carry
their canoes. And by what I could learn
from them, this is the road they take
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>when their war parties make their excursions
upon the Pawnees and Pawnawnees,
nations inhabiting some branches of the
Messorie River. In the country belonging
to these people it is said, that Mandrakes
are frequently found, a species of
root resembling human beings of both
sexes; and that these are more perfect
than such as are discovered about the Nile
in Nether-Ethiopia.</p>

<p class='c000'>A little to the north-west of the heads
of the Messorie and the St. Pierre, the
Indians further told me, that there was a
nation rather smaller and whiter than the
neighbouring tribes, who cultivate the
ground, and (as far as I could gather
from their expressions) in some measure,
the arts. To this account they added
that some of the nations, who inhabit
those parts that lie to the west of the
Shining Mountains, have gold so plenty
among them that they make their most
common utensils of it. These mountains
(which I shall describe more particularly
hereafter) divide the waters that fall into
the South Sea from those that run into
the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span>The people dwelling near them are
supposed to be some of the different tribes
that were tributary to the Mexican kings,
and who fled from their native country to
seek an asylum in these parts, about the
time of the conquest of Mexico by the
Spaniards, more than two centuries ago.</p>

<p class='c000'>As some confirmation of this supposition
it is remarked, that they have chosen
the most interior parts for their retreat,
being still prepossessed with a notion that
the sea-coasts have been infested ever since
with monsters vomiting fire, and hurling
about thunder and lightning; from whose
bowels issued men, who, with unseen
instruments, or by the power of magick,
killed the harmless Indians at an astonishing
distance. From such as these, their
fore-fathers (according to a tradition among
them that still remains unimpaired) fled
to the retired abodes they now inhabit.
For as they found that the floating monsters
which had thus terrified them could
not approach the land, and that those
who had descended from their sides did
not care to make excursions to any considerable
distance from them, they formed
a resolution to betake themselves to
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span>some country, that lay far from the sea-coasts,
where only they could be secure
from such diabolical enemies. They accordingly
set out with their families, and
after a long peregrination, settled themselves
near these mountains, where they
concluded they had found a place of perfect
security.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Winnebagoes, dwelling on the
Fox River (whom I have already treated
of) are likewise supposed to be some strolling
band from the Mexican countries.
But they are able to give only an imperfect
account of their original residence.
They say they formerly came a great way
from the westward, and were driven by
wars to take refuge among the Naudowessies;
but as they are entirely ignorant of
the arts, or of the value of gold, it is rather
to be supposed, that they were driven
from their ancient settlements by the above-mentioned
emigrants, as they passed on
towards their present habitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>These suppositions, however, may want
confirmation; for the smaller tribes of Indians
are subject to such various alterations
in their places of abode, from the wars
they are continually engaged in, that it is
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span>almost impossible to ascertain, after half a
century, the original situation of any of
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>That range of mountains, of which the
Shining Mountains are a part, begin at
Mexico, and continuing northward on the
back, or to the east of California, separate
the waters of those numerous rivers that
fall either into the Gulph of Mexico, or
the Gulph of California. From thence
continuing their course still northward,
between the sources of the Mississippi and
the rivers that run into the South Sea,
they appear to end in about forty-seven or
forty-eight degrees of north latitude; where
a number of rivers arise, and empty themselves
either into the South Sea, into Hudson’s
Bay, or into the waters that communicate
between these two seas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among these mountains, those that lie
to the west of the River St. Pierre, are
called the Shining Mountains, from an
infinite number of chrystal stones, of an
amazing size, with which they are covered,
and which, when the sun shines full
upon them, sparkle so as to be seen at a
very great distance.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>This extraordinary range of mountains
is calculated to be more than three thousand
miles in length, without any very
considerable intervals, which I believe
surpasses any thing of the kind in the
other quarters of the globe. Probably in
future ages they may be found to contain
more riches in their bowels, than those of
Indostan and Malabar, or that are produced
on the Golden Coast of Guinea; nor
will I except even the Peruvian Mines.
To the west of these mountains, when explored
by future Columbuses or Raleighs,
may be found other lakes, rivers, and
countries, full fraught with all the necessaries
or luxuries of life; and where future
generations may find an asylum,
whether driven from their country by the
ravages of lawless tyrants, or by religious
persecutions, or reluctantly leaving it to
remedy the inconveniences arising from
a superabundant increase of inhabitants;
whether, I say, impelled by these, or allured
by hopes of commercial advantages,
there is little doubt but their expectations
will be fully gratified in these rich and
unexhausted climes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>But to return to the Assinipoils and
Killistinoes, whom I left at the Grand
Portage, and from whom I received the
foregoing account of the lakes that lie to
the north-west of this place.</p>

<p class='c000'>The traders we expected being later this
season than usual, and our numbers very
considerable, for there were more than
three hundred of us, the stock of provision
we had brought with us was nearly
exhausted, and we waited with impatience
for their arrival.</p>

<p class='c000'>One day, whilst we were all expressing
our wishes for this desirable event, and
looking from an eminence in hopes of
seeing them come over the lake, the
chief priest belonging to the band of the
Killistinoes told us, that he would endeavour
to obtain a conference with the
Great Spirit, and know from him when
the traders would arrive. I paid little attention
to this declaration, supposing that
it would be productive of some juggling
trick, just sufficiently covered to deceive
the ignorant Indians. But the king of
that tribe telling me that this was chiefly
undertaken by the priest to alleviate my
anxiety, and at the same time to convince
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>me how much interest he had with the
Great Spirit, I thought it necessary to restrain
my animadversions on his design.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following evening was fixed upon
for this spiritual conference. When every
thing had been properly prepared, the
king came to me and led me to a capacious
tent, the covering of which was
drawn up, so as to render what was transacting
within visible to those who stood
without. We found the tent surrounded
by a great number of the Indians, but
we readily gained admission, and seated
ourselves on skins laid on the ground for
that purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the centre I observed that there was
a place of an oblong shape, which was
composed of stakes stuck in the ground,
with intervals between, so as to form a
kind of chest or coffin, large enough to
contain the body of a man. These were
of a middle size, and placed at such a distance
from each other, that whatever lay
within them was readily to be discerned.
The tent was perfectly illuminated by a
great number of torches made of splinters
cut from the pine or birch tree, which the
Indians held in their hands.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>In a few minutes the priest entered;
when an amazing large elk’s skin being
spread on the ground, just at my feet, he
laid himself down upon it, after having
stript himself of every garment except that
which he wore close about his middle.
Being now prostrate on his back, he first
laid hold of one side of the skin, and
folded it over him, and then the other;
leaving only his head uncovered. This
was no sooner done, than two of the
young men who stood by took about forty
yards of strong cord, made also of an elk’s
hide, and rolled it tight round his body,
so that he was completely swathed within
the skin. Being thus bound up like an
Egyptian Mummy, one took him by the
heels, and the other by the head, and
lifted him over the pales into the inclosure.
I could also now discern him as
plain as I had hitherto done, and I took
care not to turn my eyes a moment from
the object before me, that I might the
more readily detect the artifice; for such
I doubted not but that it would turn out
to be.</p>

<p class='c000'>The priest had not lain in this situation
more than a few seconds, when he began
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>to mutter. This he continued to do for
some time, and then by degrees grew
louder and louder, till at length he spoke
articulately; however what he uttered was
in such a mixed jargon of the Chipéway,
Ottowaw, and Killistinoe languages, that
I could understand but very little of it.
Having continued in this tone for a considerable
while, he at last exerted his voice
to its utmost pitch, sometimes raving and
sometimes praying, till he had worked
himself into such an agitation, that he
foamed at his mouth.</p>

<p class='c000'>After having remained near three quarters
of an hour in the place, and continued
his vociferation with unabated vigor,
he seemed to be quite exhausted, and remained
speechless. But in an instant he
sprung upon his feet, notwithstanding at
the time he was put in, it appeared impossible
for him to move either his legs or
arms, and shaking off his covering, as
quick as if the bands with which it had
been bound were burned asunder, he began
to address those who stood around in a
firm and audible voice. “My Brothers,”
said he, “the Great Spirit has deigned
to hold a Talk with his servant at my
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>earnest request. He has not, indeed,
told me when the persons we expect
will be here, but to-morrow, soon after
the sun has reached his highest point in
the heavens, a canoe will arrive, and
the people in that will inform us when
the traders will come.” Having said
this, he stepped out of the inclosure, and
after he had put on his robes, dismissed
the assembly. I own I was greatly astonished
at what I had seen; but as I observed
that every eye in the company was
fixed on me with a view to discover my
sentiments, I carefully concealed every
emotion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next day the sun shone bright,
and long before noon all the Indians were
gathered together on the eminence that
overlooked the lake. The old king came
to me and asked me, whether I had so
much confidence in what the priest had
foretold, as to join his people on the hill,
and wait for the completion of it? I told
him I was at a loss what opinion to form
of the prediction, but that I would readily
attend him. On this we walked together
to the place where the others were assembled.
Every eye was again fixed by turns
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span>on me and on the lake; when just as the
sun had reached his zenith, agreeable to
what the priest had foretold, a canoe came
round a point of land about a league distant.
The Indians no sooner beheld it,
than they sent up an universal shout, and
by their looks seemed to triumph in the
interest their priest thus evidently had with
the Great Spirit.</p>

<p class='c000'>In less than an hour the canoe reached
the shore, when I attended the king and
chiefs to receive those who were on board.
As soon as the men were landed, we
walked all together to the king’s tent,
when according to their invariable custom
we began to smoke; and this we did, notwithstanding
our impatience to know the
tidings they brought, without asking any
questions; for the Indians are the most
deliberate people in the world. However,
after some trivial conversation, the king inquired
of them whether they had seen any
thing of the traders? the men replied, that
they had parted from them a few days before,
and that they proposed being here
the second day from the present. They
accordingly arrived at that time greatly
to our satisfaction, but more particularly
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>so to that of the Indians, who found by
this event the importance both of their
priest and of their nation, greatly augmented
in the sight of a stranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>This story I acknowledge appears to
carry with it marks of great credulity in
the relator. But no one is less tinctured
with that weakness than myself. The
circumstances of it I own are of a very
extraordinary nature; however, as I can
vouch for their being free from either
exaggeration or misrepresentation, being
myself a cool and dispassionate observer
of them all, I thought it necessary to give
them to the public. And this I do without
wishing to mislead the judgment of
my Readers, or to make any superstitious
impressions on their minds, but leaving
them to draw from it what conclusions
they please.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have already observed that the Assinipoils,
with a part of whom I met
here, are a revolted band of the Naudowessies;
who on account of some real
or imagined grievances, for the Indians in
general are very tenacious of their liberty,
had separated themselves from their countrymen,
and sought for freedom at the
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span>expence of their ease. For the country
they now inhabit about the borders of Lake
Winnepeek, being much farther north,
is not near so fertile or agreeable as that
they have relinquished. They still retain
the language and manners of their former
associates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Killistinoes, now the neighbours
and allies of the Assinipoils, for they
also dwell near the same Lake and on
the waters of the River Bourbon, appear
to have been originally a tribe of the Chipéways,
as they speak their language,
though in a different dialect. Their nation
consists of about three or four hundred
warriors, and they seem to be a
hardy brave people. I have already given
an account of their country when I treated
of Lake Winnepeek. As they reside within
the limits of Hudson’s Bay, they generally
trade at the factories which belong
to that Company, but, for the reasons
mentioned before, they frequently come
to the place where I happened to join them,
in order to meet the traders from Michillimackinac.</p>

<p class='c000'>The anxiety I had felt on account of
the traders delay, was not much alleviated
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span>by their arrival. I again found my
expectations disappointed, for I was not
able to procure the goods I wanted from
any of them. I was therefore obliged to
give over my designs, and return to the
place from whence I first began my extensive
circuit. I accordingly took leave
of the old king of the Killistinoes, with
the chiefs of both bands, and departed.
This prince was upwards of sixty years
of age, tall and slightly made, but he carried
himself very erect. He was of a
courteous, affable disposition, and treated
me, as did all the chiefs, with great civility.</p>

<p class='c000'>I observed that this people still continued
a custom, that appeared to have been
universal before any of them became acquainted
with the manners of the Europeans,
that of complimenting strangers with
the company of their wives; and this is
not only practised by the lower ranks, but
by the chiefs themselves, who esteem it
the greatest proof of courtesy they can
give a stranger.</p>

<p class='c000'>The beginning of October, after having
coasted round the north and east borders
of Lake Superior, I arrived at Cadot’s
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>Fort, which adjoins to the Falls of St.
Marie, and is situated near the south-west
corner of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake Superior, formerly termed the
Upper Lake from its northern situation, is
so called on account of its being superior
in magnitude to any of the lakes on that
vast continent. It might justly be termed
the Caspian of America, and is supposed
to be the largest body of fresh water on
the globe. Its circumference, according
to the French charts, is about fifteen hundred
miles; but I believe, that if it was
coasted round, and the utmost extent of
every bay taken, it would exceed sixteen
hundred.</p>

<p class='c000'>After I first entered it from Goddard’s
River on the west Bay, I coasted near
twelve hundred miles of the north and
east shores of it, and observed that the
greatest part of that extensive tract was
bounded by rocks and uneven ground.
The water in general appeared to lie on a
bed of rocks. When it was calm, and
the sun shone bright, I could sit in my
canoe, where the depth was upwards of
six fathoms, and plainly see huge piles of
stone at the bottom, of different shapes,
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span>some of which appeared as if they were
hewn. The water at this time was as
pure and transparent as air; and my canoe
seemed as if it hung suspended in that element.
It was impossible to look attentively
through this limpid medium at the
rocks below, without finding, before many
minutes were elapsed, your head swim,
and your eyes no longer able to behold
the dazzling scene.</p>

<p class='c000'>I discovered also by accident another extraordinary
property in the waters of this
Lake. Though it was in the month of
July that I passed over it, and the surface
of the water, from the heat of the superambient
air, impregnated with no small
degree of warmth, yet on letting down a
cup to the depth of about a fathom, the
water drawn from thence was so excessively
cold, that it had the same effect when
received into the mouth as ice.</p>

<p class='c000'>The situation of this Lake is variously
laid down; but from the most exact observations
I could make, it lies between
forty-six and fifty degrees of north latitude,
and between eighty-four and ninety-three
degrees of west longitude from the
meridian of London.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span>There are many islands in this Lake,
two of which are very large; and if
the land of them is proper for cultivation,
there appears to be sufficient to
form on each a considerable province; especially
on Isle Royal, which cannot be
less than an hundred miles long, and in
many places forty broad. But there is
no way at present of ascertaining the exact
length or breadth of either. Even
the French, who always kept a small
schooner on this lake whilst they were in
possession of Canada, by which they could
have made this discovery, have only acquired
a slight knowledge of the external
parts of these islands; at least they have
never published any account of the internal
parts of them, that I could get intelligence
of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor was I able to discover from any
of the conversations which I held with
the neighbouring Indians, that they had
ever made any settlements on them, or
even landed there in their hunting excursions.
From what I could gather
by their discourse, they suppose them to
have been, from their first information,
the residence of the Great Spirit; and
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span>relate many ridiculous stories of enchantment
and magical tricks that had been
experienced by such as were obliged
through stress of weather to take shelter on
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the Chipéway chiefs told me,
that some of their people being once driven
on the island of Mauropas, which lies
towards the north-east part of the Lake,
found on it large quantities of a heavy
shining yellow sand, that from their description
must have been gold dust. Being
struck with the beautiful appearance
of it, in the morning, when they re-entered
their canoe, they attempted to bring
some away; but a spirit of an amazing
size, according to their account sixty
feet in height, strode into the water after
them, and commanded them to deliver
back what they had taken away. Terrified
at his gigantic stature, and seeing that
he had nearly overtaken them, they were
glad to restore their shining treasure; on
which they were suffered to depart without
further molestation. Since this incident,
no Indian that has ever heard
of it, will venture near the same haunted
coast. Besides this, they recounted to me
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>many other stories of these islands, equally
fabulous.</p>

<p class='c000'>The country on the north and east
parts of Lake Superior is very mountainous
and barren. The weather being intensely
cold in the winter, and the sun
having but little power in the summer,
vegetation there is very slow; and consequently
but little fruit is to be found on
its shore. It however produces some few
species in great abundance. Whirtleberries
of an uncommon size, and fine
flavour, grow on the mountains near the
Lake in amazing quantities; as do black
currants and goosberries in the same luxuriant
manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the fruit which exceeds all the
others, is a berry resembling a rasberry in
its manner of growth, but of a lighter red,
and much larger; its taste is far more delicious
than the fruit I have compared
it to, notwithstanding that <a id='it'></a>it is so highly
esteemed in Europe: it grows on a shrub
of the nature of a vine, with leaves similar
to those of the grape; and I am persuaded
that was it transplanted into a warmer and
more kindly climate, it would prove a
most rare and delicious fruit.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>Two very large rivers empty themselves
into this Lake, on the north and
north-east side; one is called the Nipegon
River, or, as the French pronounce
it, the Allanipegon, which leads to a band
of the Chipéways, inhabiting a lake of
the same name, and the other is termed
the Michipicooton River, the source of
which is situated towards James’s Bay,
from whence there is but a short carriage
to another river, which empties itself into
that bay, at a fort belonging to the Company.
It was by this passage that a
party of French from Michillimackinac
invaded the settlements of that Society in
the reign of Queen Anne. Having taken
and destroyed their forts, they brought
the cannon which they found in them
to the fortress from whence they had
issued; these were small brass pieces, and
remain there to this present time; having,
through the usual revolutions of fortune,
returned to the possession of their
former masters.</p>

<p class='c000'>Not far from the Nipegon is a small
river, that, just before it enters the Lake,
has a perpendicular fall from the top of
a mountain, of more than six hundred
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>feet. Being very narrow, it appears at a
distance like a white garter suspended in
the air.</p>

<p class='c000'>A few Indians inhabit round the eastern
borders of this lake, supposed to be the
remains of the Algonkins, who formerly
possessed this country, but who have been
nearly extirpated by the Iroquois of Canada.
Lake Superior has near forty rivers
that fall into it, some of which are
of a considerable size. On the south side
of it is a remarkable point or cape, of
about sixty miles in length, called Point
Chegomegan. It might as properly be
termed a peninsula, as it is nearly separated
from the continent, on the east side,
by a narrow bay that extends from east to
west. Canoes have but a short portage
across the isthmus, whereas if they coast
it round, the voyage is more than an hundred
miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>About that distance to the west of the
cape just described, a considerable river
falls into the Lake, the head of which is
composed of a great assemblage of small
streams. This river is remarkable for the
abundance of virgin copper that is found
on and near its banks. A metal which
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>is met with also in several other places
on this coast. I observed that many of
the small islands, particularly those on
the eastern shores, were covered with copper
ore. They appeared like beds of copperas,
of which many tuns lay in a small
space.</p>

<p class='c000'>A company of adventurers from England
began, soon after the conquest of
Canada, to bring away some of this metal,
but the distracted situation of affairs in
America has obliged them to relinquish
their scheme. It might in future times
be made a very advantageous trade, as the
metal, which costs nothing on the spot,
and requires but little expence to get it on
board, could be conveyed in boats or canoes
through the Falls of St. Marie to
the Isle of St. Joseph, which lies at the
bottom of the Straights near the entrance
into Lake Huron; from thence it might
be put on board larger vessels, and in
them transported across that Lake to the
Falls of Niagara; there being carried by
land across the Portage, it might be conveyed
without much more obstruction to
Quebec. The cheapness and ease with
which any quantity of it may be procured,
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span>will make up for the length of way that
it is necessary to transport it before it
reaches the sea-coast, and enable the proprietors
to send it to foreign markets on
as good terms as it can be exported from
other countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake Superior abounds with variety of
fish, the principal and best are the trout
and sturgeon, which may be caught at
almost any season in the greatest abundance.
The trouts in general weigh about
twelve pounds, but some are caught that
exceed fifty. Besides these, a species of
white fish is taken in great quantities
here, that resemble a shad in their shape,
but they are rather thicker, and less bony;
they weigh about four pounds each, and
are of a delicious taste. The best way of
catching these fish is with a net; but the
trout might be taken at all times with
the hook. There are likewise many sorts
of smaller fish in great plenty here, and
which may be taken with ease; among
these is a sort resembling a herring, that
are generally made use of as a bait for the
trout. Very small crabs, not larger than
half a crown piece, are found both in this
and Lake Michegan.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span>This Lake is as much affected by storms
as the Atlantic Ocean; the waves run as
high, and are equally as dangerous to
ships. It discharges its waters from the
south-east corner, through the Straights
of St. Marie. At the upper end of these
Straights stands a fort that receives its
name from them, commanded by Mons.
Cadot, a French Canadian, who being proprietor
of the soil, is still permitted to keep
possession of it. Near this fort is a very
strong rapid, against which, though it is
impossible for canoes to ascend, yet when
conducted by careful pilots, they might
pass down without danger.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though Lake Superior, as I have before
observed, is supplied by near forty rivers,
many of which are considerable ones,
yet it does not appear that one-tenth part
of the waters which are conveyed into it
by these rivers are carried off at this evacuation.
How such a superabundance of
water can be disposed of, as it must certainly
be by some means or other, without
which the circumference of the lake
would be continually enlarging, I know
not: that it does not empty itself, as the
Mediterranean Sea is supposed to do, by
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>an under current, which perpetually counteracts
that near the surface, is certain;
for the stream which falls over the rock
is not more than five or six feet in depth,
and the whole of it passes on through the
Straights into the adjacent lake; nor is it
probable that so great a quantity can be
absorbed by exhalations; consequently
they must find a passage through some subterranean
cavities, deep, unfathomable, and
never to be explored.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Falls of St. Marie do not descend
perpendicularly as those of Niagara
or St. Anthony do, but consist of a rapid
which continues near three quarters of a
mile, over which canoes well piloted might
pass.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the bottom of these Falls, Nature
has formed a most commodious station for
catching the fish which are to be found
there in immense quantities. Persons
standing on the rocks that lie adjacent
to it, may take with dipping nets, about
the months of September and October,
the white fish before mentioned; at that
season, together with several other species,
they croud up to this spot in such
amazing shoals, that enough may be
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span>taken to supply, when properly cured,
thousands of inhabitants throughout the
year.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Straights of St. Marie are about
forty miles long, bearing south-east, but
varying much in their breadth. The
current between the Falls and Lake Huron
is not so rapid as might be expected,
nor do they prevent the navigation of
ships of burden as far up as the island of
St. Joseph.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been observed by travellers that
the entrance into Lake Superior, from
these Straights, affords one of the most
pleasing prospects in the world. The place
in which this might be viewed to the
greatest advantage, is just at the opening
of the lake, from whence may be seen
on the left, many beautiful little islands
that extend a considerable way before
you; and on the right, an agreeable succession
of small points of land, that project
a little way into the water, and contribute,
with the islands, to render this
delightful bason (as it might be termed)
calm and secure from the ravages of those
tempestuous winds by which the adjoining
lake is frequently troubled.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span>Lake Huron, into which you now enter
from the Straights of St. Marie, is the
next in magnitude to Lake Superior. It
lies between forty-two and forty-six degrees
of north latitude, and seventy-nine
and eighty-five degrees of west longitude.
Its shape is nearly triangular, and its circumference
about one thousand miles.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the north side of it lies an island
that is remarkable for being near an hundred
miles in length, and no more than
eight miles broad. This island is known
by the name of Manataulin, which signifies
a Place of Spirits, and is considered by
the Indians as sacred as those already mentioned
in Lake Superior.</p>

<p class='c000'>About the middle of the south-west side
of this lake is Saganaum Bay. The capes
that separate this bay from the lake, are
about eighteen miles distant from each
other; near the middle of the intermediate
space stand two islands, which greatly tend
to facilitate the passage of canoes and small
vessels, by affording them shelter, as without
this security it would not be prudent
to venture across so wide a sea; and the
coasting round the bay would make the voyage
long and tedious. This bay is about
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>eighty miles in length, and in general
about eighteen or twenty miles broad.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nearly half way between Saganaum
Bay and the north-west corner of the Lake
lies another, which is termed Thunder
Bay. The Indians, who have frequented
these parts from time immemorial, and
every European traveller that has passed
through it, have unanimously agreed to
call it by this name, on account of the
continual thunder they have always observed
here. The bay is about nine miles
broad, and the same in length, and whilst
I was passing over it, which took me up
near twenty-four hours, it thundered and
lightened during the greatest part of the
time to an excessive degree.</p>

<p class='c000'>There appeared to be no visible reason
for this that I could discover, nor is the
country in general subject to thunder;
the hills that stood around were not of
a remarkable height, neither did the external
parts of them seem to be covered
with any sulphureous substance. But as
this phænomenon must originate from
some natural cause, I conjecture that the
shores of the bay, or the adjacent mountains,
are either impregnated with an uncommon
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>quantity of sulphureous matter,
or contain some metal or mineral apt to
attract in a great degree the electrical particles
that are hourly borne over them
by the passant clouds. But the solution
of this, and those other philosophical remarks
which casually occur throughout
these pages, I leave to the discussion of
abler heads.</p>

<p class='c000'>The fish in Lake Huron are much the
same as those in Lake Superior. Some
of the land on its banks is very fertile,
and proper for cultivation, but in other
parts it is sandy and barren. The promontory
that separates this lake from Lake
Michegan, is composed of a vast plain,
upwards of one hundred miles long, but
varying in its breadth, being from ten to
fifteen miles broad. This track, as I have
before observed, is divided into almost an
equal portion between the Ottowaw and
Chipéway Indians. At the north-east corner
this lake has a communication with
Lake Michegan, by the Straights of Michillimackinac
already described.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had like to have omitted a very extraordinary
circumstance relative to these
Straights. According to observations made
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span>by the French, whilst they were in possession
of the fort, although there is no
diurnal flood or ebb to be perceived in
these waters, yet, from an exact attention
to their state, a periodical alteration in
them has been discovered. It was observed
that they arose by gradual, but almost
imperceptible degrees till they had
reached the height of about three feet.
This was accomplished in seven years and
a half; and in the same space they as
gently decreased, till they had reached
their former situation; so that in fifteen
years they had completed this inexplicable
revolution. At the time I was there
the truth of these observations could not
be confirmed by the English, as they had
then been only a few years in possession of
the fort; but they all agreed that some
alteration in the limits of the Straights
was apparent. All these lakes are so affected
by the winds, as sometimes to have
the appearance of a tide, according as they
happen to blow; but this is only temporary
and partial.</p>

<p class='c000'>A great number of the Chipéway Indians
live scattered around this Lake, particularly
near Saganaum Bay. On its
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>banks are found an amazing quantity of
the sand cherries, and in the adjacent country
nearly the same fruits as those that
grow about the other lakes.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the Falls of St. Marie I leisurely
proceeded back to Michillimackinac, and
arrived there the beginning of November
1767, having been fourteen months on
this extensive tour, travelled near four
thousand miles, and visited twelve nations
of Indians lying to the west and north of
this place. The winter setting in soon
after my arrival, I was obliged to tarry
there till the June following, the navigation
over Lake Huron for large vessels
not being open, on account of the ice,
till that time. Meeting here with sociable
company, I passed these months very
agreeably, and without finding the hours
tedious.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of my chief amusements was that
of fishing for trouts. Though the Straights
were covered with ice, we found means
to make holes through it, and letting down
strong lines of fifteen yards in length, to
which were fixed three or four hooks
baited with the small fish before described,
we frequently caught two at a time of
<span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span>forty pounds weight each; but the common
size is from ten to twenty pounds.
These are most delicious food. The method
of preserving them during the three
months the winter generally lasts, is by
hanging them up in the air; and in one
night they will be frozen so hard, that
they will keep as well as if they were
cured with salt.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have only pointed out in the plan of
my travels the circuit I made from my
leaving Michillimackinac till I arrived
again at that fort. Those countries that
lie nearer to the colonies have been so
often and so minutely described, that any
further account of them would be useless.
I shall therefore only give my Readers
in the remainder of my journal, as I
at first proposed, a description of the other
great lakes of Canada, many of which I
have navigated over, and relate at the same
time a few particular incidents that I trust
will not be found inapplicable or unentertaining.</p>

<p class='c000'>In June 1768 I left Michillimackinac,
and returned in the Gladwyn Schooner, a
vessel of about eighty tons burthen, over
Lake Huron to Lake St. Claire, where we
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span>left the ship, and proceeded in boats to
Detroit. This lake is about ninety miles
in circumference, and by the way of
Huron River, which runs from the south
corner of Lake Huron, receives the waters
of the three great lakes, Superior,
Michegan, and Huron. Its form is rather
round, and in some places it is deep
enough for the navigation of large vessels,
but towards the middle of it there is a
bar of sand, which prevents those that
are loaded from passing over it. Such
as are in ballast only may find water sufficient
to carry them quite through; the
cargoes, however, of such as are freighted
must be taken out, and after being transported
across the bar in boats, reshipped
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>The river that runs from Lake St.
Claire to Lake Erie (or rather the Straight,
for thus it might be termed from its name)
is called Detroit, which is in French, the
Straight. It runs nearly south, has a
gentle current, and depth of water sufficient
for ships of considerable burthen. The
town of Detroit is situated on the western
banks of this river, about nine miles below
Lake St. Claire.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>Almost opposite, on the eastern shore,
is the village of the ancient Hurons: a
tribe of Indians which have been treated
of by so many writers, that adhering to
the restrictions I have laid myself under
of only describing places and people little
known, or incidents that have passed unnoticed
by others, I shall omit giving a
description of them. A missionary of the
order of Carthusian Friars, by permission
of the bishop of Canada, resides among
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The banks of the River Detroit, both
above and below these towns, are covered
with settlements that extend more than
twenty miles; the country being exceedingly
fruitful, and proper for the cultivation
of wheat, Indian corn, oats, and peas.
It has also many spots of fine pasturage;
but as the inhabitants, who are chiefly
French that submitted to the English government
after the conquest of these parts
by General Amherst, are more attentive <a id='to'></a>to
the Indian trade than to farming, it is
but badly cultivated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The town of Detroit contains upwards
of one hundred houses. The streets
are somewhat regular, and have a range of
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>very convenient and handsome barracks,
with a spacious parade at the south end.
On the west side lies the King’s garden
belonging to the governor, which is very
well laid out and kept in good order. The
fortifications of the town consist of a
strong stockade made of round piles, fixed
firmly in the ground, and lined with palisades.
These are defended by some small
bastions, on which are mounted a few indifferent
cannon of an inconsiderable size,
just sufficient for its defence against the Indians,
or an enemy not provided with artillery.</p>

<p class='c000'>The garrison, in time of peace, consists
of two hundred men commanded by a
field officer, who acts as chief magistrate
under the governor of Canada. Mr. Turnbull,
captain of the 60th regiment, or
Royal Americans, was commandant when
I happened to be there. This gentleman
was deservedly esteemed and respected,
both by the inhabitants and traders, for the
propriety of his conduct; and I am happy
to have an opportunity of thus publickly
making my acknowledgments to him, for
the civilities I received from him during
my stay.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>In the year 1762, in the month of
July, it rained on this town and the parts
adjacent, a sulphureous water of the colour
and consistence of ink; some of which being
collected into bottles, and wrote with
appeared perfectly intelligible on the paper,
and answered every purpose of that
useful liquid. Soon after, the Indian
wars already spoken of, broke out in these
parts. I mean not to say that this incident
was ominous of them, notwithstanding
it is well known that innumerable
well attested instances of extraordinary
phænomena happening before extraordinary
events, have been recorded in almost
every age by historians of veracity; I only
relate the circumstances as a fact of which
I was informed by many persons of undoubted
probity, and leave my Readers, as
I have hitherto done, to draw their own
conclusions from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pontiac, under whom the party that
surprized Fort Michillimackinac, as related
in the former part of this work,
acted, was an enterprizing chief or head-warrior
of the Miames. During the late
war between the English and the French
he had been a steady friend to the latter,
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>and continued his inveteracy to the former
even after peace had been concluded
between these two nations. Unwilling
to put an end to the depredations he had
been so long engaged in, he collected an
army of confederate Indians, consisting
of the nations before enumerated, with
an intention to renew the war. However,
instead of openly attacking the English
settlements, he laid a scheme for taking
by surprize those forts on the extremities
which they had lately gained possession
of.</p>

<p class='c000'>How well the party he detached to
take Fort Michillimackinac succeeded, the
Reader already knows. To get into his
hands Detroit, a place of greater consequence,
and much better guarded, required
greater resolution, and more consummate
art. He of course took the
management of this expedition on himself,
and drew near it with the principal
body of his troops. He was however
prevented from carrying his designs into
execution by an apparently trivial and unforeseen
circumstance. On such does
the fate of mighty Empires frequently depend!</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>The town of Detroit, when Pontiac
formed his plan, was garrisoned by about
three hundred men commanded by Major
Gladwyn, a gallant officer. As at
that time every appearance of war was at
an end, and the Indians seemed to be on
a friendly footing, Pontiac approached
the Fort, without exciting any suspicions
in the breast of the governor or the inhabitants.
He encamped at a little distance
from it, and sent to let the commandant
know that he was come to trade; and
being desirous of brightening the chain of
peace between the English and his nation,
desired that he and his chiefs may
be admitted to hold a council with him.
The governor still unsuspicious, and not
in the least doubting the sincerity of the
Indians, granted their general’s request,
and fixed on the next morning for their
reception.</p>

<p class='c000'>The evening of that day, an Indian
woman who had been employed by Major
Gladwyn to make him a pair of Indian
shoes, out of curious elk-skin, brought
them home. The Major was so pleased
with them, that, intending these as a
present for a friend, he ordered her to
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>take the remainder back, and make it
into others for himself. He then directed
his servant to pay her for those she
had done, and dismissed her. The woman
went to the door that led to the
street, but no further; she there loitered
about as if she had not finished the business
on which she came. A servant at
length observed her, and asked her why
she staid there; she gave him, however,
no answer.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some short time after, the governor
himself saw her; and enquired of his
servant what occasioned her stay. Not
being able to get a satisfactory answer,
he ordered the woman to be called in.
When she came into his presence he desired
to know what was the reason of her
loitering about, and not hastening home
before the gates were shut, that she might
complete in due time the work he had
given her to do. She told him, after
much hesitation, that as he had always behaved
with great goodness towards her,
she was unwilling to take away the remainder
of the skin, because he put so
great a value upon it; and yet had not
been able to prevail upon herself to tell
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span>him so. He then asked her, why she was
more reluctant to do so now, than she
had been when she made the former pair.
With increased reluctance she answered,
that she never should be able to bring
them back.</p>

<p class='c000'>His curiosity being now excited, he
insisted on her disclosing to him the secret
that seemed to be struggling in her bosom
for utterance. At last, on receiving
a promise that the intelligence she was
about to give him should not turn to her
prejudice, and that if it appeared to be
beneficial she should be rewarded for it,
she informed him, that at the council to
be held with the Indians the following
day, Pontiac and his chiefs intended to
murder him; and, after having massacred
the garrison and inhabitants, to plunder
the town. That for this purpose all the
chiefs who were to be admitted into the
council-room had cut their guns short,
so that they could conceal them under
their blankets; with which, at a signal
given by their general on delivering the
belt, they were all to rise up, and instantly
to fire on him and his attendants.
Having effected this, they were immediately
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>to rush into the town, where
they would find themselves supported by
a great number of their warriors, that
were to come into it during the sitting
of the council, under pretence of trading,
but privately armed in the same manner.
Having gained from the woman
every necessary particular relative to the
plot, and also the means by which she acquired
a knowledge of them, he dismissed
her with injunctions of secrecy, and a
promise of fulfilling on his part with
punctuality the engagements he had entered
into.</p>

<p class='c000'>The intelligence the governor had just
received, gave him great uneasiness; and
he immediately consulted the officer who
was next to him in command on the subject.
But that gentleman considering the
information as a story invented for some
artful purposes, advised him to pay no
attention to it. This conclusion however
had happily no weight with him. He
thought it prudent to conclude it to be
true, till he was convinced that it was
not so; and therefore, without revealing
his suspicions to any other person, he
took every needful precaution that the
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span>time would admit of. He walked round
the fort during the whole night, and saw
himself that every centinel was on duty,
and every weapon of defence in proper
order.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he traversed the ramparts which
lay nearest to the Indian camp, he heard
them in high festivity, and, little imagining
that their plot was discovered,
probably pleasing themselves with the
anticipation of their success. As soon as
the morning dawned, he ordered all the
garrison under arms; and then imparting
his apprehensions to a few of the principal
officers, gave them such directions as
he thought necessary. At the same time
he sent round to all the traders, to inform
them, that as it was expected a
great number of Indians would enter the
town that day, who might be inclined
to plunder, he desired they would have
their arms ready, and repel every attempt
of that kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>About ten o’clock, Pontiac and his
chiefs arrived; and were conducted to the
council-chamber, where the governor and
his principal officers, each with pistols
in their belts, awaited his arrival. As
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span>the Indians passed on, they could not
help observing that a greater number of
troops than usual were drawn up on the
parade, or marching about. No sooner
were they entered, and seated on the
skins prepared for them, than Pontiac
asked the governor on what occasion his
young men, meaning the soldiers, were
thus drawn up, and parading the streets.
He received for answer, that it was only
intended to keep them perfect in their exercise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indian chief-warrior now began
his speech, which contained the strongest
professions of friendship and good-will
towards the English; and when he came
to the delivery of the belt of wampum,
the particular mode of which, according
to the woman’s information, was to be
the signal for his chiefs to fire, the governor
and all his attendants drew their
swords half-way out of their scabbards;
and the soldiers at the same instant made
a clattering with their arms before the
doors, which had been purposely left
open. Pontiac, though one of the boldest
of men, immediately turned pale, and
trembled; and instead of giving the belt
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span>in the manner proposed, delivered it according
to the usual way. His chiefs, who
had impatiently expected the signal, looked
at each other with astonishment, but continued
quiet, waiting the result.</p>

<p class='c000'>The governor in his turn made a
speech; but instead of thanking the great
warrior for the professions of friendship
he had just uttered, he accused him of
being a traitor. He told him that the
English, who knew every thing, were convinced
of his treachery and villainous designs;
and as a proof that they were well
acquainted with his most secret thoughts
and intentions, he stepped towards the
Indian chief that sat nearest to him, and
drawing aside his blanket discovered the
shortened firelock. This entirely disconcerted
the Indians, and frustrated their
design.</p>

<p class='c000'>He then continued to tell them, that
as he had given his word at the time they
desired an audience, that their persons
should be safe, he would hold his promise
inviolable, though they so little deserved
it. However he advised them to make
the best of their way out of the fort, lest
his young men, on being acquainted with
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span>their treacherous purposes, should cut
every one of them to pieces. Pontiac endeavoured
to contradict the accusation,
and to make excuses for his suspicious conduct;
but the governor, satisfied of the
falsity of his protestations, would not listen
to him. The Indians immediately left
the fort, but instead of being sensible of
the governor’s generous behaviour, they
threw off the mask, and the next day made
a regular attack upon it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Major Gladwyn has not escaped censure
for this mistaken lenity; for probably
had he kept a few of the principal
chiefs prisoners, whilst he had them
in his power, he might have been able
to have brought the whole confederacy
to terms, and have prevented a war.
But he atoned for this oversight, by the
gallant defence he made for more than
a year, amidst a variety of discouragements.</p>

<p class='c000'>During that period some very smart
skirmishes happened between the besiegers
and the garrison, of which the following
was the principal and most bloody.
Captain Delzel, a brave officer, prevailed
on the governor to give him the command
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span>of about two hundred men, and to permit
him to attack the enemy’s camp. This
being complied with, he sallied from the
town before day-break; but Pontiac, receiving
from some of his swift-footed warriors,
who were constantly employed in
watching the motions of the garrison,
timely intelligence of their design, he
collected together the choicest of his
troops, and met the detachment at some
distance from his camp, near a place since
called Bloody-Bridge. As the Indians
were vastly superior in numbers to captain
Delzel’s party, he was soon overpowered
and driven back. Being now
nearly surrounded, he made a vigorous
effort to regain the bridge he had just
crossed, by which alone he could find a
retreat; but in doing this he lost his life,
and many of his men fell with him. However,
Major Rogers, the second in command,
assisted by Lieutenant Breham, found
means to draw off the shattered remains
of their little army, and conducted them
into the fort.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus considerably reduced, it was with
difficulty the Major could defend the
town; notwithstanding which, he held
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>out against the Indians till he was relieved,
as after this they made but few attacks
on the place, and only continued to
blockade it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Gladwyn Schooner (that in which
I afterwards took my passage from Michillimackinac
to Detroit, and which I
since learn was lost with all her crew on
Lake Erie, through the obstinacy of the
commander, who could not be prevailed
upon to take in sufficient ballast) arrived
about this time near the town with a reinforcement
and necessary supplies. But
before this vessel could reach the place of
its destination, it was most vigorously attacked
by a detachment from Pontiac’s
army. The Indians surrounded it in
their canoes, and made great havock among
the crew. At length the captain of the
schooner with a considerable number of
his men being killed, and the savages beginning
to climb up its sides from every
quarter, the Lieutenant (Mr. Jacobs, who
afterwards commanded, and was lost in
it) being determined that the stores should
not fall into the enemy’s hands, and seeing
no other alternative, ordered the gunner
to set fire to the powder-room, and
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span>blow the ship up. This order was on the
point of being executed, when a chief of
the Hurons, who understood the English
language, gave out to his friends the intention
of the commander. On receiving
this intelligence the Indians hurried down
the sides of the ship with the greatest precipitation,
and got as far from it as possible;
whilst the commander immediately
took advantage of their consternation, and
arrived without any further obstruction at
the town.</p>

<p class='c000'>This seasonable supply gave the garrison
fresh spirits; and Pontiac being now
convinced that it would not be in his
power to reduce the place, proposed an
accommodation; the governor wishing as
much to get rid of such troublesome enemies,
who obstructed the intercourse of
the traders with the neighbouring nations,
listened to his proposals, and having procured
advantageous terms, agreed to a peace.
The Indians soon after separated, and returned
to their different provinces; nor
have they since thought proper to disturb,
at least in any great degree, the tranquillity
of these parts.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>Pontiac henceforward seemed to have
laid aside the animosity he had hitherto
borne towards the English, and apparently
became their zealous friend. To reward
this new attachment, and to insure
a continuance of it, government allowed
him a handsome pension. But his
restless and intriguing spirit would not
suffer him to be grateful for this allowance,
and his conduct, at length grew
suspicious; so that going, in the year
1767, to hold a council in the country
of the Illinois, a faithful Indian, who was
either commissioned by one of the English
governors, or instigated by the love
he bore the English nation, attended him
as a spy; and being convinced from the
speech Pontiac made in the council that he
still retained his former prejudices against
those for whom he now professed a friendship,
he plunged his knife into his heart,
as soon as he had done speaking, and laid
him dead on the spot.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return from this digression.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake Erie receives the waters by which
it is supplied from the three great lakes,
through the Straights of Detroit, that lie
at its north-west corner. This Lake is
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span>situated between forty-one and forty-three
degrees of north latitude, and between seventy-eight
and eighty-three degrees of
west longitude. It is near three hundred
miles long from east to west, and about
forty in its broadest part: and a remarkable
long narrow point lies on its north
side, that projects for several miles into the
lake towards the south-east.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are several islands near the west
end of it so infested with rattle-snakes, that
it is very dangerous to land on them. It
is impossible that any place can produce a
greater number of all kinds of these reptiles
than this does, particularly of the
water-snake. The Lake is covered near
the banks of the islands with the large
pond-lily; the leaves of which lie on the
surface of the water so thick, as to cover it
entirely for many acres together; and on
each of these lay, when I passed over it,
wreaths of water-snakes basking in the sun,
which amounted to myriads.</p>

<p class='c000'>The most remarkable of the different
species that infest this Lake, is the hissing-snake,
which is of the small speckled
kind, and about eighteen inches long.
When any thing approaches, it flattens
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span>itself in a moment, and its spots, which
are of various dyes, become visibly brighter
through rage; at the same time it blows
from its mouth with great force a subtile
wind, that is reported to be of a nauseous
smell; and if drawn in with the breath of
the unwary traveller, will infallibly bring
on a decline, that in a few months must
prove mortal, there being no remedy yet
discovered which can counteract its baneful
influence.</p>

<p class='c000'>The stones and pebbles on the shores of
this Lake are most of them tinged, in a
greater or less degree, with spots that resemble
brass in their colour, but which are
of a sulphureous nature. Small pieces,
about the size of hazle-nuts, of the same
kinds of ore, are found on the lands that
lie on its banks, and under the water.</p>

<p class='c000'>The navigation of this Lake is esteemed
more dangerous than any of the others on
account of many high lands that lie on
the borders of it, and project into the water
in a perpendicular direction for many
miles together; so that whenever sudden
storms arise, canoes and boats are frequently
lost, as there is no place for them to
find a shelter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span>This Lake discharges its waters at the
north-east end, into the River Niagara,
which runs north and south, and is about
thirty-six miles in length; from whence
it falls into Lake Ontario. At the entrance
of this river, on its eastern shore,
lies Fort Niagara; and, about eighteen
miles further up, those remarkable Falls
which are esteemed one of the most extraordinary
productions of nature at present
known.</p>

<p class='c000'>As these have been visited by so many
travellers, and so frequently described, I
shall omit giving a particular description
of them, and only observe, that the waters
by which they are supplied, after
taking their rise near two thousand miles
to the north-west, and passing through the
Lakes Superior, Michegan, Huron, and
Erie, during which they have been receiving
constant accumulations, at length rush
down a stupendous precipice of one hundred
and forty feet perpendicular; and in
a strong rapid, that extends to the distance
of eight or nine miles below, fall nearly
as much more: this River soon after empties
itself into Lake Ontario.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span>The noise of these Falls might be heard
an amazing way. I could plainly distinguish
them in a calm morning more
than twenty miles. Others have said that
at particular times, and when the wind
sits fair, the sound of them reaches fifteen
leagues.</p>

<p class='c000'>The land about the Falls is exceedingly
hilly and uneven, but the greatest part of
that on the Niagara River is very good,
especially for grass and pasturage.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fort Niagara stands nearly at the entrance
of the west end of Lake Ontario,
and on the east part of the Straights of
Niagara. It was taken from the French
in the year 1759, by the forces under the
command of Sir William Johnson, and
at present is defended by a considerable
garrison.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake Ontario is the next, and least of
the five great Lakes of Canada. Its situation
is between forty-three and forty-five
degrees of latitude, and between seventy-six
and seventy-nine degrees of west longitude.
The form of it is nearly oval,
its greatest length being from north-east
to south-west, and in circumference, about
six hundred miles. Near the south-east
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span>part it receives the waters of the Oswego
River, and on the north-east discharges itself
into the River Cataraqui. Not far
from the place where it issues, Fort Frontenac
formerly stood, which was taken
from the French during the last war, in
the year 1758, by a small army of Provincials
under Colonel Bradstreet.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the entrance of Oswego River stands
a fort of the same name, garrisoned only
at present by an inconsiderable party. This
fort was taken in the year 1756 by the
French, when a great part of the garrison,
which consisted of the late Shirley’s and
Pepperil’s regiments, were massacred in
cold blood by the savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>In Lake Ontario are taken many sorts
of fish, among which is the Oswego Bass,
of an excellent flavour, and weighing about
three or four pounds. There is also a sort
called the Cat-head or Pout, which are in
general very large, some of them weighing
eight or ten pounds; and they are esteemed
a rare dish when properly dressed.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the north-west parts of this Lake,
and to the south-east of Lake Huron, is a
tribe of Indians called the Missisauges,
whose town is denominated Toronto, from
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span>the lake on which it lies; but they are
not very numerous. The country about
Lake Ontario, especially the more north
and eastern parts, is composed of good
land, and in time may make very flourishing
settlements.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Oniada Lake, situated near the
head of the River Oswego, receives the
waters of Wood-Creek, which takes its
rise not far from the Mohawks River.
These two lie so adjacent to each other,
that a junction is effected by sluices at
Fort Stanwix, about twelve miles from
the mouth of the former. This Lake is
about thirty miles long from east to west,
and near fifteen broad. The country
around it belongs to the Oniada Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake Champlain, the next in size to
Lake Ontario, and which lies nearly east
from it, is about eighty miles in length,
north and south, and in its broadest part
fourteen. It is well stored with fish, and
the lands that lie on all the borders of it,
or about its rivers, very good.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake George, formerly called by the
French Lake St. Sacrament, lies to the
south-west of the last-mentioned lake,
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>and is about thirty-five miles long from
north-east to south-west, but of no great
breadth. The country around it is very
mountainous, but in the vallies the land
is tolerably good.</p>

<p class='c000'>When these two lakes were first discovered,
they were known by no other
name than that of the Iroquois Lakes; and
I believe in the first plans taken of those
parts were so denominated. The Indians
also that were then called the Iroquois,
are since known by the name of the Five
Mohawk Nations, and the Mohawks of
Canada. In the late war, the former,
which consist of the Onondagoes, the Oniadas,
the Senecas, the Tuscarories, and
Iroondocks, fought on the side of the
English: the latter, which are called the
Cohnawaghans, and St. Francis Indians,
joined the French.</p>

<p class='c000'>A vast tract of land that lies between
the two last-mentioned lakes and Lake
Ontario, was granted in the year 1629
by the Plymouth Company, under a patent
they had received from King James I.
to Sir Ferdinando Gorges, and to Captain
John Mason, the head of that family, afterwards
distinguished from others of the
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span>same name by the Masons of Connecticut.
The countries specified in this grant are said
to begin ten miles from the heads of the
rivers that run from the east and south
into Lake George and Lake Champlain;
and continuing from these in a direct line
westward, extend to the middle of Lake
Ontario; from thence, being bounded by
the Cataraqui, or the River of the Iroquois,
they take their course through Montreal,
as far as Fort Sorrell, which lies at
the junction of this river with the Richlieu;
and from that point are inclosed by
the last-mentioned river till it returns back
to the two lakes.</p>

<p class='c000'>This immense space was granted, by
the name of the Province of Laconia, to
the aforesaid gentlemen on specified conditions,
and under certain penalties; but
none of these amounted, in case of omission
in the fulfillment of any part of
them, to forfeiture, a fine only could be
exacted.</p>

<p class='c000'>On account of the continual wars to
which these parts have been subject, from
their situation between the settlements of
the English, the French, and the Indians,
this grant has been suffered to lie dormant
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>by the real proprietors. Notwithstanding
which, several towns have been settled
since the late war, on the borders of Lake
Champlain, and grants made to different
people by the governor of New York of
part of these territories, which are now
become annexed to that province.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are a great number of lakes on
the north of Canada, between Labrador,
Lake Superior, and Hudson’s Bay, but
these are comparatively small. As they
lie out of the track that I pursued, I
shall only give a summary account of
them. The most westerly of these are the
Lakes Nipising and Tamiscaming. The
first lies at the head of the French River,
and runs into Lake Huron; the other on
the Ottowaw River, which empties itself
into the Cataraqui, at Montreal. These
lakes are each about one hundred miles
in circumference.</p>

<p class='c000'>The next is Lake Mistassin, on the
head of Rupert’s River, that falls into
James’s Bay. This Lake is so irregular
from the large points of land by which
it is intersected on every side, that it is difficult
either to describe its shape, or to
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>ascertain its size. It however appears on
the whole to be more than two hundred
miles in circumference.</p>

<p class='c000'>Lake St. John, which is about eighty
miles round, and of a circular form, lies
on the Saguenay River, directly north of
Quebec, and falls into the St. Lawrence,
somewhat north-east of that city. Lake
Manikouagone lies near the head of the
Black River, which empties itself into
the St. Lawrence to the eastward of the
last-mentioned river, near the coast of Labrador,
and is about sixty miles in circumference.
Lake Pertibi, Lake Wincktagan,
Lake Etchelaugon, and Lake Papenouagane,
with a number of other small lakes,
lie near the heads of the Bustard River to
the north of the St. Lawrence. Many
others, which it is unnecessary to particularize
here, are also found between the
Lakes Huron and Ontario.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole of those I have enumerated,
amounting to upwards of twenty, are
within the limits of Canada; and from
this account it might be deduced, that
the northern parts of North America,
through these numerous inland seas, contain
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span>a greater quantity of water than any
other quarter of the globe.</p>

<p class='c000'>In October 1768 I arrived at Boston,
having been absent from it on this expedition
two years and five months, and
during that time travelled near seven thousand
miles. From thence, as soon as I
had properly digested my Journal and
Charts, I set out for England, to communicate
the discoveries I had made, and
to render them beneficial to the kingdom.
But the prosecution of my plans for reaping
these advantages have hitherto been
obstructed by the unhappy divisions that
have been fomented between Great Britain
and the Colonies by their mutual enemies.
Should peace once more be restored, I
doubt not but that the countries I have
described will prove a more abundant source
of riches to this nation than either its East
or West Indian settlements; and I shall
not only pride myself, but sincerely rejoice
in being the means of pointing out
to it so valuable an acquisition.</p>

<p class='c000'>I cannot conclude the account of my
extensive travels, without expressing my
gratitude to that beneficent Being who invisibly
protected me through those perils
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span>which unavoidably attended so long a tour
among fierce and untutored savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time let me not be accused
of vanity or presumption, if I declare that
the motives alledged in the Introduction
of this work, were not the only ones that
induced me to engage in this arduous undertaking.
My views were not solely
confined to the advantages that might accrue,
either to myself, or the community
to which I belonged; but nobler purposes
contributed principally to urge me on.</p>

<p class='c000'>The confined state, both with regard
to civil and religious improvements, in
which so many of my fellow creatures
remained, aroused within my bosom an
irresistible inclination to explore the almost
unknown regions which they inhabited;
and, as a preparatory step towards
the introduction of more polished manners,
and more humane sentiments, to gain a
knowledge of their language, customs,
and principles.</p>

<p class='c000'>I confess that the little benefit too many
of the Indian nations have hitherto received
from their intercourse with those
who denominate themselves Christians, did
not tend to encourage my charitable purposes;
<span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span>yet, as many, though not the generality,
might receive some benefit from
the introduction among them of the policy
and religion of the Europeans, without
retaining only the errors or vices that
from the depravity and perversion of their
professors are unhappily attendant on these,
I determined to persevere.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor could I flatter myself that I should
be able to accomplish alone this great design;
however, I was willing to contribute
as much as lay in my power towards
it. In all public undertakings would every
one do this, and furnish with alacrity his
particular share towards it, what stupendous
works might not be completed.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is true that the Indians are not
without some sense of religion, and such
as proves that they worship the Great
Creator with a degree of purity unknown
to nations who have greater opportunities
of improvement; but their religious principles
are far from being so faultless as
described by a learned writer, or unmixed
with opinions and ceremonies that greatly
lessen their excellency in this point. So
that could the doctrines of genuine and
vital Christianity be introduced among
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span>them, pure and untainted as it flowed
from the lips of its Divine Institutor, it
would certainly tend to clear away that
superstitious or idolatrous dross by which
the rationality of their religious tenets are
obscured. Its mild and beneficent precepts
would likewise conduce to soften
their implacable dispositions, and to refine
their savage manners; an event most desirable;
and happy shall I esteem myself
if this publication shall prove the means
of pointing out the path by which salutary
instructions may be conveyed to
them, and the conversion, though but of
a few, be the consequence.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>THE means by which America received
its first Inhabitants, have,
since the time of its discovery by the Europeans,
been the subject of numberless
disquisitions. Was I to endeavour to collect
the different opinions and reasonings
of the various writers that have taken up
the pen in defence of their conjectures,
the enumeration would much exceed the
bounds I have prescribed myself, and
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span>oblige me to be less explicit on points of
greater moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the obscurity in which this debate
is enveloped, through the total disuse
of letters among every nation of Indians
on this extensive continent, and
the uncertainty of oral tradition at the
distance of so many ages, I fear, that
even after the most minute investigation
we shall not be able to settle it with any
great degree of certainty. And this apprehension
will receive additional force,
when it is considered that the diversity of
language which is apparently distinct between
most of the Indians, tends to ascertain
that this population was not effected
from one particular country, but
from several neighbouring ones, and completed
at different periods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Most of the historians or travellers that
have treated on the American Aborigines
disagree in their sentiments relative to
them. Many of the ancients are supposed
to have known that this quarter of
the globe not only existed, but also that
it was inhabited. Plato in his Timæus
has asserted, that beyond the island which
he calls Atalantis, and which according to
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>his description was situated in the western
Ocean, there were a great number of
other islands, and behind those a vast
Continent.</p>

<p class='c000'>Oviedo, a celebrated Spanish author of
a much later date, has made no scruple to
affirm that the Antilles are the famous
Hesperides so often mentioned by the
poets; which are at length restored to the
kings of Spain, the descendants of King
Hesperus, who lived upwards of three
thousand years ago, and from whom these
islands received their name.</p>

<p class='c000'>Two other Spaniards, the one, Father
Gregorio Garcia, a Dominican, the other,
Father Joseph De Acosta, a Jesuit, have
written on the origin of the Americans.</p>

<p class='c000'>The former, who had been employed
in the missions of Mexico and Peru, endeavoured
to prove from the traditions
of the Mexicans, Peruvians, and others,
which he received on the spot, and from
the variety of characters, customs, languages,
and religion observable in the different
countries of the new world, that
different nations had contributed to the
peopling of it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span>The latter, Father De Acosta, in his
examination of the means by which the
first Indians of America might have found
a passage to that continent, discredits the
conclusions of those who have supposed
it to be by sea, because no ancient author
has made mention of the compass: and
concludes, that it must be either by the
north of Asia and Europe, which adjoin
to each other, or by those regions that lie
to the southward of the Straights of Magellan.
He also rejects the assertions of
such as have advanced that it was peopled
by the Hebrews.</p>

<p class='c000'>John De Laët, a Flemish writer, has
controverted the opinions of these Spanish
fathers, and of many others who have
written on the same subject. The hypothesis
he endeavours to establish, is, that
America was certainly peopled by the
Scythians or Tartars; and that the transmigration
of these people happened soon
after the dispersion of Noah’s grandsons.
He undertakes to show, that the most
northern Americans have a greater resemblance,
not only in the features of their
countenances, but also in their complexion
and manner of living, to the Scythians,
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>Tartars, and Samoeides, than to any other
nations.</p>

<p class='c000'>In answer to Grotius, who had asserted
that some of the Norwegians passed into
America by way of Greenland, and over
a vast continent, he says, that it is well
known that Greenland was not discovered
till the year 964; and both Gomera and
Herrera inform us that the Chichimeques
were settled on the Lake of Mexico in
721. He adds, that these savages, according
to the uniform tradition of the
Mexicans who dispossessed them, came from
the country since called New Mexico,
and from the neighbourhood of California;
consequently North America must have
been inhabited many ages before it could
receive any inhabitants from Norway by
way of Greenland.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is no less certain, he observes, that
the real Mexicans founded their empire in
902, after having subdued the Chichimeques,
the Otomias, and other barbarous
nations, who had taken possession
of the country round the Lake of Mexico,
and each of whom spoke a language peculiar
to themselves. The real Mexicans
are likewise supposed to come from some
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>of the countries that lie near California,
and that they performed their journey for
the most part by land; of course they
could not come from Norway.</p>

<p class='c000'>De Laët further adds, that though
some of the inhabitants of North America
may have entered it from the north-west,
yet, as it is related by Pliny and some
other writers, that on many of the islands
near the western coast of Africa, particularly
on the Canaries, some ancient edifices
were seen, it is highly probable from
their being now deserted, that the inhabitants
may have passed over to America;
the passage being neither long nor difficult.
This migration, according to the
calculation of those authors, must have
happened more than two thousand years
ago, at a time when the Spaniards were
much troubled by the Carthaginians;
from whom having obtained a knowledge
of Navigation, and the construction of
ships, they might have retired to the
Antilles, by the way of the western isles,
which were exactly half way on their
voyage.</p>

<p class='c000'>He thinks also that Great Britain, Ireland,
and the Orcades were extremely
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span>proper to admit of a similar conjecture.
As a proof, he inserts the following passage
from the History of Wales, written
by Dr. David Powel in the year 1170.</p>

<p class='c000'>This historian says, that Madoc, one
of the sons of Prince Owen Gwynnith,
being disgusted at the civil wars which
broke out between his brothers, after the
death of their father, fitted out several
vessels, and having provided them with
every thing necessary for a long voyage,
went in quest of new lands to the westward
of Ireland; there he discovered very
fertile countries, but destitute of inhabitants;
when landing part of his people,
he returned to Britain, where he raised
new levies, and afterwards transported
them to his colony.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Flemish Author then returns to
the Scythians, between whom and the
Americans he draws a parallel. He observes
that several nations of them to the
north of the Caspian Sea led a wandering
life; which, as well as many other of
their customs, and way of living, agrees
in many circumstances with the Indians
of America. And though the resemblances
are not absolutely perfect, yet the emigrants,
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>even before they left their own
country, differed from each other, and
went not by the same name. Their
change of abode affected what remained.</p>

<p class='c000'>He further says, that a similar likeness
exists between several American nations,
and the Samoeides who are settled,
according to the Russian accounts, on
the great River Oby. And it is more
natural, continues he, to suppose that
Colonies of these nations passed over to
America by crossing the icy sea on their
sledges, than for the Norwegians to travel
all the way Grotius has marked out for
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>This writer makes many other remarks
that are equally sensible, and which
appear to be just; but he intermixes
with these some that are not so well-founded.</p>

<p class='c000'>Emanuel de Moraez, a <a id='port'></a>Portuguese, in
his history of Brazil, asserts that America
has been wholly peopled by the Carthaginians
and Israelites. He brings as a
proof of this assertion the discoveries the
former are known to have made at a great
distance beyond the coast of Africa. The
progress of which being put a stop to by
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span>the senate of Carthage, those who happened
to be then in the newly discovered
countries, being cut off from all communication
with their countrymen, and destitute
of many necessaries of life, fell
into a state of barbarism. As to the Israelites,
this author thinks that nothing
but circumcision is wanted in order to
constitute a perfect resemblance between
them and the Brazilians.</p>

<p class='c000'>George De Hornn, a learned Dutchman,
has likewise written on this subject.
He sets out with declaring, that he does
not believe it possible America could have
been peopled before the flood, considering
the short space of time which elapsed between
the creation of the world and that
memorable event. In the next place he
lays it down as a principle, that after the
deluge, men and other terrestrial animals
penetrated into that country both by sea
and by land; some through accident,
and some from a formed design. That
birds got thither by flight; which they
were enabled to do by resting on the
rocks and islands that are scattered about
in the Ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span>He further observes, that wild beasts
may have found a free passage by land;
and that if we do not meet with horses or
cattle (to which he might have added elephants,
camels, rhinoceros, and beasts of
many other kinds) it is because those nations
that passed thither, were either not
acquainted with their use, or had no convenience
to support them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having totally excluded many nations
that others have admitted as the probable
first settlers of America, for which he
gives substantial reasons, he supposes that
it began to be peopled by the north; and
maintains, that the primitive colonies
spread themselves by the means of the
isthmus of Panama through the whole
extent of the continent.</p>

<p class='c000'>He believes that the first founders of
the Indian Colonies were Scythians. That
the Phœnicians and Carthaginians afterwards
got footing in America across the
Atlantic Ocean, and the Chinese by way
of the Pacific. And that other nations
might from time to time have landed
there by one or other of these ways, or
might possibly have been thrown on the
coast by tempests: since, through the
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span>whole extent of that Continent, both in
its northern and southern parts, we meet
with undoubted marks of a mixture of
the northern nations with those who have
come from other places. And lastly, that
some Jews and Christians might have been
carried there by such like events, but that
this must have happened at a time when
the whole of the new world was already
peopled.</p>

<p class='c000'>After all, he acknowledges that great
difficulties attend the determination of the
question. These, he says, are occasioned
in the first place by the imperfect knowledge
we have of the extremities of the
globe, towards the north and south pole;
and in the next place to the havock
which the Spaniards, the first discoverers
of the new world, made among its most
ancient monuments; as witness the great
double road betwixt Quito and Cuzco,
an undertaking so stupendous, that even
the most magnificent of those executed
by the Romans cannot be compared to
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>He supposes also another migration of
the Phœnicians, than those already mentioned,
to have taken place; and this was
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>during a three years voyage made by the
Tyrian fleet in the service of King Solomon.
He asserts on the authority of Josephus,
that the port at which this embarkation
was made lay in the Mediterranean.
The fleet, he adds, went in quest
of elephants teeth and peacocks to the
western Coast of Africa, which is Tarsish;
then to Ophir for gold, which is Haité,
or the island of Hispaniola; and in the
latter opinion he is supported by Columbus,
who, when he discovered that island,
thought he could trace the furnaces in
which the gold was refined.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these migrations which preceded the
Christian æra, he adds many others of a
later date from different nations, but these
I have not time to enumerate. For the
same reason I am obliged to pass over
numberless writers on this subject; and
shall content myself with only giving the
sentiments of two or three more.</p>

<p class='c000'>The first of these is Pierre De Charlevoix,
a Frenchman, who, in his journal
of a voyage to North America, made so
lately as the year 1720, has recapitulated
the opinions of a variety of authors on
this head, to which he has subjoined his
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span>own conjectures. But the latter cannot
without some difficulty be extracted, as
they are so interwoven with the passages
he has quoted, that it requires much attention
to discriminate them.</p>

<p class='c000'>He seems to allow that America might
have received its first inhabitants from
Tartary and Hyrcania. This he confirms,
by observing that the lions and
tigers which are found in the former,
must have come from those countries, and
whose passage serves for a proof that the
two hemispheres join to the northward of
Asia. He then draws a corroboration of
this argument, from a story he says he
has often heard related by Father Grollon,
a French jesuit, as an undoubted matter
of fact.</p>

<p class='c000'>This Father, after having laboured some
time in the missions of New France,
passed over to those of China. One day
as he was travelling in Tartary, he met
a Huron woman whom he had formerly
known in Canada. He asked her by
what adventure she had been carried into
a country so distant from her own. She
made answer, that having been taken in
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span>war, she had been conducted from nation
to nation, till she had reached the place at
which she then was.</p>

<p class='c000'>Monsieur Charlevoix says further, that
he had been assured, another Jesuit, passing
through Nantz in his return from
China, had related much such another affair
of a Spanish woman from Florida.
She also had been taken by certain Indians,
and given to those of a more distant
country; and by these again to another
nation, till having thus been successively
passed from country to country, and traveled
through regions extremely cold, she at
last found herself in Tartary. Here she
had married a Tartar, who had attended
the conquerors into China, where she was
then settled.</p>

<p class='c000'>He acknowledges as an allay to the
probability of these stories, that those
who had sailed farthest to the eastward
of Asia, by pursuing the Coast of Jesso or
Kamtschatka, have pretended that they
had perceived the extremity of this continent;
and from thence have concluded
that there could not possibly be any communication
by land. But he adds that
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span>Francis Guella, a Spaniard, is said to have
asserted, that this separation is no more
than a straight, about one hundred miles
over, and that some late voyages of the
Japonese give grounds to think that this
straight is only a bay, above which there
is a passage over land.</p>

<p class='c000'>He goes on to observe, that though
there are few wild beasts to be met with
in North America, except a kind of tigers
without spots, which are found in
the country of the Iroquoise, yet towards
the tropics there are lions and real tigers,
which, notwithstanding, might have
come from Hyrcania and Tartary; for as
by advancing gradually southward they
met with climates more agreeable to their
natures, they have in time abandoned the
northern countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>He quotes both Solinus and Pliny to
prove that the Scythian Anthropophagi
once depopulated a great extent of country,
as far as the promontory Tabin; and
also an author of later date, Mark Pol, a
Venetian, who, he says, tells us, that to
the north-east of China and Tartary there
are vast uninhabited countries, which
might be sufficient to confirm any conjectures
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>concerning the retreat of a great number
of Scythians into America.</p>

<p class='c000'>To this he adds, that we find in the antients
the names of some of these nations.
Pliny speaks of the Tabians; Solinus
mentions the Apuleans, who had for
neighbours the Massagetes, whom Pliny
since assures us to have entirely disappeared.
Ammianus Marcellinus expresly
tells us, that the fear of the Anthropophagi
obliged several of the inhabitants of
those countries to take refuge elsewhere.
From all these authorities Mons. Charlevoix
concludes, that there is at least room
to conjecture that more than one nation
in America had a Scythian or Tartarian
original.</p>

<p class='c000'>He finishes his remarks on the authors
he has quoted, by the following observations:
It appears to me that this controversy
may be reduced to the two following
articles; first, how the new world
might have been peopled; and secondly,
by whom, and by what means it has
been peopled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing, he asserts, may be more
easily answered than the first. America
might have been peopled as the three
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span>other parts of the world have been. Many
difficulties have been formed on this subject,
which have been deemed insolvable,
but which are far from being so. The
inhabitants of both hemispheres are certainly
the descendants of the same father;
the common parent of mankind received
an express command from heaven to people
the whole world, and accordingly it has
been peopled.</p>

<p class='c000'>To bring this about it was necessary
to overcome all difficulties that lay in
the way, and they have been got over.
Were these difficulties greater with respect
to peopling the extremities of Asia,
Africa, and Europe, or the transporting
men into the islands which lie at a considerable
distance from those continents,
than to pass over into America? certainly
not.</p>

<p class='c000'>Navigation, which has arrived at so
great perfection within these three or four
centuries, might possibly have been more
perfect in those early ages than at this day.
Who can believe that Noah and his immediate
descendants knew less of this art
than we do? That the builder and pilot
of the largest ship that ever was, a ship
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>that was formed to traverse an unbounded
ocean, and had so many shoals and quicksands
to guard against, should be ignorant
of, or should not have communicated to
those of his descendants who survived him,
and by whose means he was to execute the
order of the Great Creator; I say, who
can believe he should not have communicated
to them the art of sailing upon an
ocean, which was not only more calm and
pacific, but at the same time confined within
its ancient limits?</p>

<p class='c000'>Admitting this, how easy is it to pass,
exclusive of the passage already described,
by land from the coast of Africa to Brazil,
from the Canaries to the Western Islands,
and from them to the Antilles? From the
British Isles, or the coast of France, to
Newfoundland, the passage is neither long
nor difficult; I might say as much of that
from China to Japan; from Japan, or the
Phillipines, to the Isles Mariannes; and
from thence to Mexico.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are islands at a considerable distance
from the continent of Asia, where
we have not been surprized to find inhabitants,
why then should we wonder to
meet with people in America? Nor can
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>it be imagined that the grandsons of Noah,
when they were obliged to separate and
spread themselves in conformity to the designs
of God, over the whole earth, should
find it absolutely impossible to people almost
one half of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have been more copious in my extracts
from this author than I intended, as
his reasons appear to be solid, and many
of his observations just. From this encomium,
however, I must exclude the
stories he has introduced of the Huron and
Floridan women, which I think I might
venture to pronounce fabulous.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall only add, to give my Readers a
more comprehensive view of Mons. Charlevoix’s
dissertation, the method he proposes
to come at the truth of what we
are in search of.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only means by which this can be
done, he says, is by comparing the languages
of the Americans with the different
nations, from whence we might suppose
they have peregrinated. If we compare
the former with those words that are considered
as primitives, it might possibly set
us upon some happy discovery. And this
way of ascending to the original of nations,
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span>which is by far the least equivocal,
is not so difficult as might be imagined.
We have had, and still have, travellers
and missionaries who have attained the
languages that are spoken in all the provinces
of the new world; it would only
be necessary to make a collection of their
grammars and vocabularies, and to collate
them with the dead and living languages
of the old world, that pass for originals,
and the similarity might easily be
traced. Even the different dialects, in spite
of the alterations they have undergone,
still retain enough of the mother tongue
to furnish considerable lights.</p>

<p class='c000'>Any enquiry into the manners, customs,
religion, or traditions of the Americans,
in order to discover by that means
their origin, he thinks would prove fallacious.
A disquisition of that kind, he
observes, is only capable of producing a
false light, more likely to dazzle, and to
make us wander from the right path, than
to lead us with certainty to the point proposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ancient traditions are effaced from the
minds of such as either have not, or for
several ages have been without, those helps
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span>that are necessary to preserve them. And
in this situation is full one half of the
world. New events, and a new arrangement
of things, give rise to new traditions,
which efface the former, and are
themselves effaced in turn. After one or
two centuries have passed, there no longer
remain any traces of the first traditions;
and thus we are involved in a state of uncertainty.</p>

<p class='c000'>He concludes with the following remarks,
among many others. Unforeseen
accidents, tempests, and shipwrecks, have
certainly contributed to people every habitable
part of the world: and ought we
to wonder, after this, at perceiving certain
resemblances, both of persons and manners,
between nations that are most remote
from each other, when we find such
a difference between those that border on
one another? As we are destitute of historical
monuments, there is nothing, I repeat
it, but a knowledge of the primitive
languages that is capable of throwing any
light upon these clouds of impenetrable
darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this enquiry we should at least be
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span>satisfied, among that prodigious number
of various nations inhabiting America,
and differing so much in languages from
each other, which are those who make
use of words totally and entirely different
from those of the old world, and
who consequently must be reckoned to
have passed over to America in the earliest
ages, and those who, from the analogy
of their language with such as are at present
used in the three other parts of the
globe, leave room to judge that their migration
has been more recent, and which
ought to be attributed to shipwrecks, or
to some accident similar to those which
have been spoken of in the course of this
treatise.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall only add the opinion of one
author more before I give my own sentiments
on the subject, and that is of James
Adair, Esq; who resided forty years
among the Indians, and published the history
of them in the year 1772. In his
learned and systematical history of those
nations, inhabiting the western parts of
the most southern of the American colonies,
this gentleman without hesitation
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span>pronounces that the American Aborigines
are descended from the Israelites, either
whilst they were a maritime power, or
soon after their general captivity.</p>

<p class='c000'>This descent he endeavours to prove
from their religious rites, their civil and
martial customs, their marriages, their
funeral ceremonies, their manners, language,
traditions, and from a variety of
other particulars. And so complete is his
conviction on this head, that he fancies
he finds a perfect and indisputable similitude
in each. Through all these I have
not time to follow him, and shall therefore
only give a few extracts to show on
what foundation he builds his conjectures,
and what degree of credit he is entitled to
on this point.</p>

<p class='c000'>He begins with observing, that though
some have supposed the Americans to be
descended from the Chinese, yet neither
their religion, laws, or customs agree
in the least with those of the Chinese;
which sufficiently proves that they are not
of this line. Besides, as our best ships
are now almost half a year in sailing for
China (our author does not here recollect
that this is from a high northern latitude,
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span>across the Line, and then back again
greatly to the northward of it, and not directly
athwart the Pacific Ocean for only
one hundred and eleven degrees) or from
thence to Europe, it is very unlikely they
should attempt such dangerous discoveries,
with their supposed small vessels, against
rapid currents, and in dark and sickly
Monsoons.</p>

<p class='c000'>He further remarks, that this is more
particularly improbable, as there is reason
to believe that this nation was unacquainted
with the use of the loadstone
to direct their course. China, he says, is
about eight thousand miles distant from
the American continent, which is twice
as far as across the Atlantic Ocean. And
we are not informed by any ancient writer
of their maritime skill, or so much as
any inclination that way, besides small
coasting voyages. The winds blow likewise,
with little variation from east to
west within the latitudes thirty and odd,
north and south; and therefore these
could not drive them on the American
coast, it lying directly contrary to such
a course.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span>Neither could persons, according to
this writer’s account, sail to America from
the north by the way of Tartary or Ancient
Scythia; that, from its situation,
never having been or can be a maritime
power; and it is utterly impracticable, he
says, for any to come to America by sea
from that quarter. Besides, the remaining
traces of their religious ceremonies
and civil and martial customs are quite opposite
to the like vestiges of the Old Scythians.
Even in the moderate northern
climates there is not to be seen the least
trace of any ancient stately buildings, or
of any thick settlements, as are said to remain
in the less healthy regions of Peru
and Mexico. And several of the Indian
nations assure us, that they crossed the
Mississippi before they made their present
northern settlements; which, connected
with the former arguments, he concludes
will sufficiently explode that weak opinion
of the American Aborigines being lineally
descended from the Tartars or ancient
Scythians.</p>

<p class='c000'>Mr. Adair’s reasons for supposing that
the Americans derive their origin from the
Jews are,</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span>First, because they are divided into
tribes, and have chiefs over them as the
Israelites had.</p>

<p class='c000'>Secondly, because, as by a strict permanent
divine precept, the Hebrew nation
were ordered to worship, at Jerusalem,
Jehovah the true and living God, so
do the Indians, stiling him Yohewah.
The ancient Heathens, he adds, it is well
known worshipped a plurality of gods,
but the Indians pay their religious devoirs
to the Great beneficent supreme holy
Spirit of Fire, who resides, as they think,
above the clouds, and on earth also
with unpolluted people. They pay no
adoration to images, or to dead persons,
neither to the celestial luminaries, to evil
spirits, nor to any created beings whatever.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thirdly, because, agreeable to the theocracy
or divine government of Israel, the
Indians think the deity to be the immediate
head of their state.</p>

<p class='c000'>Fourthly, because, as the Jews believe
in the ministration of angels, the Indians
also believe that the higher regions are inhabited
by good spirits.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>Fifthly, because the Indian language
and dialects appear to have the very idiom
and genius of the Hebrew. Their words
and sentences being expressive, concise,
emphatical, sonorous, and bold; and
often, both in letters, and signification,
are synonimous with the Hebrew language.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sixthly, because they count their time
after the manner of the Hebrews.</p>

<p class='c000'>Seventhly, because in conformity to, or
after the manner of the Jews, they have
their prophets, high-priests, and other religious
orders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Eighthly, because their festivals, fasts,
and religious rites have a great resemblance
to those of the Hebrews.</p>

<p class='c000'>Ninthly, because the Indians, before
they go to war, have many preparatory
ceremonies of purification and fasting, like
what is recorded of the Israelites.</p>

<p class='c000'>Tenthly, because the same taste for
ornaments, and the same kind are made
use of by the Indians, as by the Hebrews.</p>

<p class='c000'>These and many other arguments of a
similar nature, Mr. Adair brings in support
of his favourite system; but I should
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>imagine, that if the Indians are really derived
from the Hebrews, among their religious
ceremonies, on which he chiefly
seems to build his hypothesis, the principal,
that of circumcision, would never
have been laid aside, and its very remembrance
obliterated.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus numerous and diverse are the
opinions of those who have hitherto written
on this subject! I shall not, however,
either endeavour to reconcile them,
or to point out the errors of each, but
proceed to give my own sentiments on
the origin of the Americans; which are
founded on conclusions drawn from the
most rational arguments of the writers
I have mentioned, and from my own
observations; the consistency of these I
shall leave to the judgment of my Readers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The better to introduce my conjectures
on this head, it is necessary first to ascertain
the distances between America and
those parts of the habitable globe that approach
nearest to it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Continent of America, as far as
we can judge from all the researches that
have been made near the poles, appears
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>to be entirely separated from the other
quarters of the world. That part of Europe
which approaches nearest to it, is
the coast of Greenland, lying in about
seventy degrees of north latitude; and
which reaches within twelve degrees of
the coast of Labrador, situated on the
north-east borders of this continent. The
coast of Guinea is the nearest part of
Africa; which lies about eighteen hundred
and sixty miles north-east from the
Brazils. The most eastern coast of Asia,
which extends to the Korean Sea on the
north of China, projects north-east through
eastern Tartary and Kamschatka to Siberia,
in about sixty degrees of north latitude.
Towards which the western coasts of
America, from California to the Straights
of Annian, extend nearly north-west, and
lie in about forty-six degrees of the same
latitude.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whether the Continent of America
stretches any farther north than these
straights, and joins to the eastern parts
of Asia, agreeable to what has been asserted
by some of the writers I have
quoted, or whether the lands that have
been discovered in the intermediate parts
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span>are only an archipelago of islands verging
towards the opposite continent, is not yet
ascertained.</p>

<p class='c000'>It being, however, certain that there
are many considerable islands which lie
between the extremities of Asia and America,
viz. Japon, Yeso or Jedso, Gama’s
Land, Behring’s Isle, with many others
discovered by Tschirikow, and besides
these, from fifty degrees north there appearing
to be a cluster of islands that reach
as far as Siberia, it is probable from their
proximity to America, that it received its
first inhabitants from them.</p>

<p class='c000'>This conclusion is the most rational I
am able to draw, supposing that since the
Aborigines got footing on this continent,
no extraordinary or sudden change in the
position or surface of it has taken place,
from inundations, earthquakes, or any revolutions
of the earth that we are at present
unacquainted with.</p>

<p class='c000'>To me it appears highly improbable
that it should have been peopled from different
quarters, across the Ocean, as others
have asserted. From the size of the ships
made use of in those early ages, and the
want of the compass, it cannot be supposed
<span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span>that any maritime nation would by
choice venture over the unfathomable
Ocean in search of distant continents.
Had this however been attempted, or had
America been first accidentally peopled
from ships freighted with passengers of
both sexes which were driven by strong
easterly winds across the Atlantic, these
settlers must have retained some traces of
the language of the country from whence
they migrated; and this since the discovery
of it by the Europeans must have
been made out. It also appears extraordinary
that several of these accidental migrations,
as allowed by some, and these
from different parts, should have taken
place.</p>

<p class='c000'>Upon the whole, after the most critical
enquiries, and the maturest deliberation,
I am of opinion, that America received
its first inhabitants from the north-east,
by way of the great archipelago just
mentioned, and from these alone. But
this might have been effected at different
times, and from various parts: from Tartary,
China, Japon, or Kamschatka, the
inhabitants of these places resembling each
other in colour, features, and shape;
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span>and who, before some of them acquired
a knowledge of the arts and sciences,
might have likewise resembled each other
in their manners, customs, religion, and
language.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only difference between the Chinese
nation and the Tartars lies in the
cultivated state of the one, and the unpolished
situation of the others. The
former have become a commercial people,
and dwell in houses formed into regular
towns and cities; the latter live
chiefly in tents, and rove about in different
hords, without any fixed abode.
Nor can the long and bloody wars these
two nations have been engaged in, exterminate
their hereditary similitude. The
present family of the Chinese emperors is
of Tartarian extraction; and if they were
not sensible of some claim beside that
of conquest, so numerous a people would
scarcely sit quiet under the dominion of
strangers.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is very evident that some of the manners
and customs of the American Indians
resemble those of the Tartars; and
I make no doubt but that in some future
æra, and this not a very distant one, it
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span>will be reduced to a certainty, that during
some of the wars between the Tartars and
the Chinese, a part of the inhabitants of
the northern provinces were driven from
their native country, and took refuge in
some of the isles before-mentioned, and
from thence found their way into America.
At different periods each nation might
prove victorious, and the conquered by
turns fly before their conquerors; and
from hence might arise the similitude of
the Indians to all these people, and that
animosity which exists between so many
of their tribes.</p>

<p class='c000'>It appears plainly to me that a great similarity
between the Indian and Chinese
is conspicuous in that particular custom
of shaving or plucking off the hair, and
leaving only a small tuft on the crown of
the head. This mode is said to have been
enjoined by the Tartarian emperors on
their accession to the throne of China, and
consequently is a further proof that this
custom was in use among the Tartars; to
whom as well as the Chinese, the Americans
might be indebted for it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many words also are used both by the
Chinese and Indians, which have a resemblance
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span>to each other, not only in their
sound, but their signification. The Chinese
call a slave, shungo; and the Naudowessie
Indians, whose language from their
little intercourse with the Europeans is
the least corrupted, term a dog, shungush.
The former denominate one species of their
tea, shousong; the latter call their tobacco,
shousassau. Many other of the words
used by the Indians contain the syllables
che, chaw, and chu, after the dialect of
the Chinese.</p>

<p class='c000'>There probably might be found a similar
connection between the language of
the Tartars and the American Aborigines,
were we as well acquainted with it as we
are, from a commercial intercourse, with
that of the Chinese.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am confirmed in these conjectures, by
the accounts of Kamschatka published a
few years ago by order of the Empress of
Russia. The author of which says, that
the sea which divides that peninsula from
America is full of islands; and that the
distance between Tschukotskoi-Noss, a promontory
which lies at the eastern extremity
of that country, and the coast of
America, is not more than two degrees
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>and a half of a great circle. He further
says, that there is the greatest reason to
suppose that Asia and America once joined
at this place, as the coasts of both continents
appear to have been broken into
capes and bays, which answer each other;
more especially as the inhabitants of this
part of both resemble each other in their
persons, habits, customs, and food. Their
language, indeed, he observes, does not
appear to be the same, but then the inhabitants
of each district in Kamschatka
speak a language as different from each
other, as from that spoken on the opposite
coast. These observations, to which he
adds, the similarity of the boats of the inhabitants
of each coast, and a remark that
the natives of this part of America are
wholly strangers to wine and tobacco,
which he looks upon as a proof that they
have as yet had no communication with
the natives of Europe, he says, amount to
little less than a demonstration that America
was peopled from this part of Asia.</p>

<p class='c000'>The limits of my present undertaking
will not permit me to dwell any longer
on this subject, or to enumerate any other
proofs in favour of my hypothesis. I am
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span>however so thoroughly convinced of the
certainty of it, and so desirous have I
been to obtain every testimony which can
be procured in its support, that I once
made an offer to a private society of
gentlemen, who were curious in such
researches, and to whom I had communicated
my sentiments on this point, that
I would undertake a journey, on receiving
such supplies as were needful, through
the north-east parts of Europe and Asia to
the interior parts of America, and from
thence to England; making, as I proceeded,
such observations both on the languages
and manners of the people with
whom I should be conversant, as might
tend to illustrate the doctrine I have here
laid down, and to satisfy the curiosity of
the learned or inquisitive; but as this proposal
was judged rather to require a national
than a private support, it was not
carried into execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>I am happy to find, since I formed the
foregoing conclusions, that they correspond
with the sentiments of that great
and learned historian Doctor Robertson;
and though, with him, I acknowledge
that the investigation, from its nature, is
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>so obscure and intricate that the conjectures
I have made can only be considered as
conjectures, and not indisputable conclusions,
yet they carry with them a greater
degree of probability than the suppositions
of those who assert that this continent was
peopled from another quarter.</p>

<p class='c000'>One of the Doctor’s quotations from
the Journals of Behring and Tschirikow,
who sailed from Kamschatka about the
year 1741 in quest of the New World,
appears to carry great weight with it,
and to afford our conclusions firm support:
“These commanders having shaped
their course towards the east, discovered
land, which to them appeared
to be part of the American continent;
and according to their observations, it
seems to be situated within a few degrees
of the north-west coast of California.
They had there some intercourse
with the inhabitants, who seemed
to them to resemble the North
Americans; as they presented to the
Russians the Calumet or Pipe of Peace,
which is a symbol of friendship universal
among the people of North
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span>America, and an usage of arbitrary institution
peculiar to them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>One of this incomparable writer’s own
arguments in support of his hypothesis is
also urged with great judgment, and appears
to be nearly conclusive. He says,
“We may lay it down as a certain principle
in this enquiry, that America
was not peopled by any nation of the
ancient continent, which had made considerable
progress in civilization. The
inhabitants of the New World were in
a state of society so extremely rude, as
to be unacquainted with those arts
which are the first essays of human ingenuity
in its advance towards improvement.
Even the most cultivated nations
of America were strangers to many
of those simple inventions, which were
almost coeval with society in other
parts of the world, and were known
in the earliest periods of civil life.
From this it is manifest that the tribes
which originally migrated to America,
came off from nations which must
have been no less barbarous than their
posterity, at the time when they were
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span>first discovered by the Europeans. If
ever the use of iron had been known
to the savages of America, or to their
progenitors, if ever they had employed
a plough, a loom, or a forge, the <a id='util'></a>utility
of these inventions would have
preserved them, and it is impossible
that they should have been abandoned
or forgotten.”</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>FROM the first settlement of the
French in Canada, to the conquest
of it by the English in 1760, several of
that nation, who had travelled into the interior
parts of North America, either to
trade with the Indians, or to endeavour
to make converts of them, have published
accounts of their customs, manners, &amp;c.</p>

<p class='c000'>The principal of these are Father Louis
Hennipin, Mons. Charlevoix, and the Baron
Le Hontan. The first, many years
ago, published some very judicious remarks,
<span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span>which he was the better enabled
to do by the assistance he received from
the maps and diaries of the unfortunate
Mons. De la Salle, who was assassinated
whilst he was on his travels, by some of
his own party. That gentleman’s journals
falling into Father Hennipin’s hands, he
was enabled by them to publish many
interesting particulars relative to the Indians.
But in some respects he fell very
short of that knowledge which it was in
his power to have attained from his long
residence among them. Nor was he always
(as has been already observed) exact
in his calculations, or just in the intelligence
he has given us.</p>

<p class='c000'>The accounts published by the other
two, particularly those of Charlevoix, are
very erroneous in the geographical parts,
and many of the stories told by the Baron
are mere delusions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the Jesuits, who heretofore
travelled into these parts, have also written
on this subject; but as few, if any,
of their works have been translated into
the English language, the generality of
Readers are not benefitted by them; and,
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span>indeed, had this been done, they would
have reaped but few advantages from them,
as they have chiefly confined their observations
to the religious principles of the
savages, and the steps taken for their conversion.</p>

<p class='c000'>Since the conquest of Canada, some of
our own countrymen, who have lived
among the Indians, and learned their language,
have published their observations;
however as their travels have not extended
to any of the interior parts I treat of, but
have only been made among the nations
that border on our settlements, a knowledge
of the genuine and uncontaminated
customs and manners of the Indians could
not have been acquired by them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The southern tribes, and those that have
held a constant intercourse with the French
or English, cannot have preserved their
manners or their customs in their original
purity. They could not avoid acquiring
the vices with the language of those they
conversed with; and the frequent intoxications
they experienced through the baneful
juices introduced among them by the
Europeans, have completed a total alteration
in their characters.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span>In such as these, a confused medley of
principles or usages are only to be observed;
their real and unpolluted customs
could be seen among those nations alone
that have held but little communications
with the provinces. These I found in the
north-west parts, and therefore flatter myself
that I am able to give a more just account
of the customs and manners of the
Indians, in their ancient purity, than any
that has been hitherto published. I have
made observations on thirty nations, and
though most of these have differed in their
languages, there has appeared a great similarity
in their manners, and from these
have I endeavoured to extract the following
remarks.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I do not propose to give a regular
and connected system of Indian concerns,
but only to relate such particulars of their
manners, customs, &amp;c. as I thought most
worthy of notice, and which interfere as
little as possible with the accounts given
by other writers, I must beg my Readers
to excuse their not being arranged systematically,
or treated of in a more copious
manner.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>The Indian nations do not appear to
me to differ so widely in their make, colour,
or constitution from each other, as
represented by some writers. They are
in general slight made, rather tall and
strait, and you seldom see any among
them deformed; their skin is of a reddish
or copper colour; their eyes are large and
black, and their hair of the same hue,
but very rarely is it curled; they have
good teeth, and their breath is as sweet
as the air they draw in; their cheekbones
rather raised, but more so in the
women than the men; the former are not
quite so tall as the European women, however
you frequently meet with good faces
and agreeable persons among them, although
they are more inclined to be fat
than the other sex.</p>

<p class='c000'>I shall not enter into a particular enquiry
whether the Indians are indebted
to nature, art, or the temperature of the
climate for the colour of their skin, nor
shall I quote any of the contradictory accounts
I have read on this subject; I shall
only say, that it appears to me to be
the tincture they received originally from
the hands of their Creator; but at what
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span>period the variation which is at present
visible both in the complexion and features
of many nations took place, at what
time the European whiteness, the jetty
hue of the African, or the copper cast of
the American were given them; which
was the original colour of the first inhabitants
of the earth, or which might be
esteemed the most perfect, I will not pretend
to determine.</p>

<p class='c000'>Many writers have asserted, that the
Indians, even at the maturest period of
their existence, are only furnished with
hair on their heads; and that notwithstanding
the profusion with which that
part is covered, those parts which among
the inhabitants of other climates are usually
the seat of this excrescence, remain
entirely free from it. Even Doctor Robertson,
through their misrepresentations,
has contributed to propagate the error;
and supposing the remark justly founded,
has drawn several conclusions from it relative
to the habit and temperature of their
bodies, which are consequently invalid.
But from minute enquiries, and a curious
inspection, I am able to declare (however
respectable I may hold the authority of
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>these historians in other points) that their
assertions are erroneous, and proceeding
from the want of a thorough knowledge
of the customs of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the age of puberty, their bodies,
in their natural state, are covered in the
same manner as those of the Europeans.
The men, indeed, esteem a beard very
unbecoming, and take great pains to get
rid of it, nor is there any ever to be perceived
on their faces, except when they
grow old, and become inattentive to their
appearance. Every crinous efflorescence
on the other parts of the body is held unseemly
by them, and both sexes employ
much time in their extirpation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Naudowessies, and the remote nations,
pluck them out with bent pieces of
hard wood, formed into a kind of nippers;
whilst those who have communication
with Europeans procure from them
wire, which they twist into a screw or
worm; applying this to the part, they
press the rings together, and with a sudden
twitch draw out all the hairs that are
inclosed between them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men of every nation differ in their
dress very little from each other, except
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span>those who trade with the Europeans;
these exchange their furs for blankets,
shirts, and other apparel, which they wear
as much for ornament as necessity. The
latter fasten by a girdle around their
waists about half a yard of broadcloth,
which covers the middle parts of their bodies.
Those who wear shirts never make
them fast either at the wrist or collar;
this would be a most insufferable confinement
to them. They throw their blanket
loose upon their shoulders, and holding
the upper side of it by the two corners,
with a knife in one hand, and a tobacco-pouch,
pipe, &amp;c. in the other, thus accoutred
they walk about in their villages
or camps: but in their dances they seldom
wear this covering.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those among the men who wish to appear
gayer than the rest, pluck from their
heads all the hair except from a spot on the
top of it, about the size of a crown-piece,
where it is permitted to grow to a considerable
length: on this are fastened plumes
of feathers of various colours with silver or
ivory quills. The manner of cutting and
ornamenting this part of the head distinguishes
different nations from each other.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>They paint their faces red and black,
which they esteem as greatly ornamental.
They also paint themselves when they go
to war: but the method they make use of
on this occasion differs from that wherein
they use it merely as a decoration.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young Indians, who are desirous
of excelling their companions in finery,
slit the outward rim of both their ears; at
the same time they take care not to separate
them entirely, but leave the flesh thus
cut still untouched at both extremities:
around this spongy substance, from the
upper to the lower part, they twist brass
wire, till the weight draws the amputated
rim into a bow of five or six inches diameter,
and drags it almost down to the
shoulder. This decoration is esteemed to
be excessively gay and becoming.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is also a common custom among
them to bore their noses, and wear in
them pendants of different sorts. I observed
that sea shells were much worn by
those of the interior parts, and reckoned
very ornamental; but how they procured
them I could not learn: probably by
their traffick with other nations nearer the
sea.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>They go without any covering for the
thigh, except that before spoken of, round
the middle, which reaches down half
way the thighs; but they make for their
legs a sort of stocking either of skins or
cloth: these are sewed as near to the
shape of the leg as possible, so as to admit
of being drawn on and off. The edges
of the stuff of which they are composed
are left annexed to the seam, and hang
loose for about the breadth of a hand: and
this part, which is placed on the outside of
the leg, is generally ornamented by those
who have any communication with Europeans,
if of cloth, with ribands or lace,
if of leather, with embroidery and porcupine
quills curiously coloured. Strangers
who hunt among the Indians in the parts
where there is a great deal of snow, find
these stockings much more convenient than
any others.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>Their shoes are made of the skin of the
deer, elk, or buffalo: these, after being
sometimes dressed according to the European
manner, at others with the hair
remaining on them, are cut into shoes,
and fashioned so as to be easy to the feet,
and convenient for walking. The edges
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span>round the ancle are decorated with pieces
of brass or tin fixed around leather strings,
about an inch long, which being placed
very thick make a cheerful tinkling noise
either when they walk or dance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The women wear a covering of some
kind or other from the neck to the knees.
Those who trade with the Europeans
wear a linen garment the same as that
used by the men; the flaps of which
hang over the petticoat. Such as dress
after their ancient manner, make a kind
of shift with leather, which covers the
body but not the arms. Their petticoats
are made either of leather or cloth, and
reach from the waist to the knee. On
their legs they wear stockings and shoes,
made and ornamented as those of the
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>They differ from each other in the mode
of dressing their heads, each following the
custom of the nation or band to which
they belong, and adhering to the form
made use of by their ancestors from time
immemorial.</p>

<p class='c000'>I remarked that most of the females,
who dwell on the east side of the Mississippi,
decorate their heads by inclosing their
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>hair either in ribands, or in plates of silver:
the latter is only made use of by the higher
ranks, as it is a costly ornament. The
silver they use on this occasion is formed
into thin plates of about four inches broad,
in several of which they confine their
hair. That plate which is nearest the
head is of a considerable width; the next
narrower, and made so as to pass a little
way under the other, and in this manner
they fasten into each other, and, gradually
tapering, descend to the waist, as represented
in <a href='#ott'>plate N<sup>o</sup> II</a>. The hair of the
Indian women being in general very long,
this proves an expensive method.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the women that live to the west of
the Mississippi, viz. the Naudowessies, the
Assinipoils, &amp;c. divide their hair in the
middle of the head, and form it into two
rolls, one against each ear. These rolls
are about three inches long, and as large
as their wrists. They hang in a perpendicular
attitude at the front of each ear,
and descend as far as the lower part of it.
A more explicit idea may be formed of
this mode by referring to <a href='#naud'>plate III</a>.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p>Pl. 3.<br /><br /><i>A Man &amp; Woman of the Naudowessie.</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>The women of every nation generally
place a spot of paint, about the size of a
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span>crown-piece, against each ear; some of
them put paint on their hair, and sometimes
a small spot in the middle of the
forehead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians, in general, pay a greater
attention to their dress and to the ornaments
with which they decorate their persons,
than to the accommodation of their huts
or tents. They construct the latter in the
following simple and expeditious manner.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being provided with poles of a proper
length, they fasten two of them across,
near their ends, with bands made of bark.
Having done this, they raise them up,
and extend the bottom of each as wide
as they purpose to make the area of the
tent: they then erect others of an equal
height, and fix them so as to support the
two principal ones. On the whole they
lay skins of the elk or deer, sewed together,
in quantity sufficient to cover the
poles, and by lapping over to form the
door. A great number of skins are sometimes
required for this purpose, as some
of their tents are very capacious. That
of the chief warrior of the Naudowessies
was at least forty feet in circumference,
and very commodious.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span>They observe no regularity in fixing
their tents when they encamp, but place
them just as it suits their conveniency.</p>

<p class='c000'>The huts also, which those who use not
tents, erect when they travel, for very
few tribes have fixed abodes or regular
towns or villages, are equally simple, and
almost as soon constructed.</p>

<p class='c000'>They fix small pliable poles in the
ground, and bending them till they meet
at the top and form a semi-circle, then lash
them together. These they cover with
mats made of rushes platted, or with birch
bark, which they carry with them in their
canoes for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>These cabins have neither chimnies nor
windows; there is only a small aperture
left in the middle of the roofs through
which the smoke is discharged, but as this
is obliged to be stopped up when it rains or
snows violently, the smoke then proves exceedingly
troublesome.</p>

<p class='c000'>They lie on skins, generally those of
the bear, which are placed in rows on the
ground; and if the floor is not large
enough to contain beds sufficient for the
accommodation of the whole family, a
frame is erected about four or five feet
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span>from the ground, in which the younger
part of it sleep.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the habitations of the Indians are
thus rude, their domestic utensils are few
in number, and plain in their formation.
The tools wherewith they fashion them
are so aukward and defective, that it is
not only impossible to form them with any
degree of neatness or elegance, but the
time required in the execution is so considerable,
as to deter them from engaging
in the manufacture of such as are not absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Naudowessies make the pots in
which they boil their victuals of the black
clay or stone mentioned in my Journal;
which resists the effects of the fire nearly
as well as iron. When they roast, if it
is a large joint or a whole animal, such as
a beaver, they fix it as Europeans do, on
a spit made of a hard wood, and placing
the ends on two forked props, now and
then turn it. If the piece is smaller they
spit it as before, and fixing the spit in an
erect but slanting position, with the meat
inclining towards the fire, frequently
change the sides, till every part is sufficiently
roasted.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span>They make their dishes in which they
serve up their meat, and their bowls and
pans, out of the knotty excrescences of the
maple tree, or any other wood. They fashion
their spoons with a tolerable decree
of neatness (as these require much less
trouble than larger utensils) from a wood
that is termed in America Spoon Wood,
and which greatly resembles box wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every tribe are now possessed of knives,
and steels to strike fire with. These being
so essentially needful for the common
uses of life, those who have not an immediate
communication with the European
traders, purchase them of such of their
neighbours as are situated nearer the settlements,
and generally give in exchange for
them slaves.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>WHEN the Indian women sit down,
they place themselves in a decent
attitude, with their knees close together;
but from being accustomed to this
posture, they walk badly, and appear to be
lame.</p>

<p class='c000'>They have no midwives amongst them,
their climate, or some peculiar happiness
in their constitutions, rendering any <a id='assist'></a>assistance
at that time unnecessary. On these
occasions they are confined but a few hours
from their usual employments, which are
commonly very laborious, as the men,
who are remarkably indolent, leave to
them every kind of drugery; even in their
hunting parties the former will not deign
to bring home the game, but send their
wives for it, though it lies at a very considerable
distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>The women place their children soon
after they are born on boards stuffed with
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span>soft moss, such as is found in morasses or
meadows. The child is laid on its back
in one of these kind of cradles, and, being
wrapped in skins or cloth to keep it warm,
is secured in it by small bent pieces of
timber.</p>

<p class='c000'>To these machines they fasten strings,
by which they hang them to branches
of trees; or if they find not trees at
hand, fasten them to a stump or stone,
whilst they transact any needful business.
In this position are the children
kept for some months. When they are
taken out, the boys are suffered to go
naked, and the girls are covered from the
neck to the knees with a shift and a short
petticoat.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indian women are remarkably decent
during their menstrual illness. Those
nations that are most remote from the
European settlements, as the Naudowessies,
&amp;c. are more particularly attentive
to this point; though they all without
exception adhere in some degree to the
same custom.</p>

<p class='c000'>In every camp or town there is an
apartment appropriated for their retirement
at this time, to which both single
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span>and married retreat, and seclude themselves
with the utmost strictness during
this period from all society. Afterwards
they purify themselves in running streams,
and return to their different employments.</p>

<p class='c000'>The men on these occasions most carefully
avoid holding any communication
with them; and the Naudowessies are so
rigid in this observance, that they will
not suffer any belonging to them to fetch
such things as are necessary, even fire, from
these female lunar retreats, though the
want of them is attended with the greatest
inconvenience. They are also so superstitious
as to think, if a pipe stem cracks,
which among them is made of wood, that
the possessor has either lighted it at one of
these polluted fires, or held some converse
with a woman during her retirement,
which is esteemed by them most disgraceful
and wicked.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians are extremely circumspect
and deliberate in every word and action;
there is nothing that hurries them into
any intemperate warmth, but that inveteracy
to their enemies which is rooted
in every Indian heart, and never can be
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span>eradicated. In all other instances they
are cool, and remarkably cautious, taking
care not to betray on any account
whatever their emotions. If an Indian
has discovered that a friend is in danger
of being intercepted and cut off by one
to whom he has rendered himself obnoxious,
he does not inform him in plain
and explicit terms of the danger he runs
by pursuing the track near which his
enemy lies in wait for him, but he first
coolly asks him which way he is going
that day; and having received his answer,
with the same indifference tells him that
he has been informed that a dog lies near
the spot, which might probably do him
a mischief. This hint proves sufficient;
and his friend avoids the danger with as
much caution as if every design and motion
of his enemy had been pointed out
to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>This apathy often shews itself on occasions
that would call forth all the fervour
of a susceptible heart. If an Indian
has been absent from his family and
friends many months, either on a war or
hunting party, when his wife and children
meet him at some distance from his
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span>habitation, instead of the affectionate sensations
that would naturally arise in the
breast of more refined beings, and be productive
of mutual congratulations, he continues
his course without paying the least
attention to those who surround him, till
he arrives at his home.</p>

<p class='c000'>He there sits down, and with the same
unconcern as if he had not been absent a
day, smokes his pipe; those of his acquaintance
who have followed him, do
the same; and perhaps it is several hours
before he relates to them the incidents
which have befallen him during his absence,
though perhaps he has left a father,
brother, or son on the field whose loss he
ought to have lamented, or has been unsuccessful
in the undertaking that called
him from his home.</p>

<p class='c000'>Has an Indian been engaged for several
days in the chace, or on any other laborious
expedition, and by accident continued
thus long without food, when
he arrives at the hut or tent of a friend
where he knows his wants may be immediately
supplied, he takes care not to
show the least symptoms of impatience, or
to betray the extreme hunger by which
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>he is tortured; but on being invited in,
sits contentedly down, and smokes his
pipe with as much composure as if every
appetite was allayed, and he was perfectly
at ease; he does the same if among
strangers. This custom is strictly adhered
to by every tribe, as they esteem it
a proof of fortitude, and think the reverse
would intitle them to the appellation of
old women.</p>

<p class='c000'>If you tell an Indian that his children
have greatly signalized themselves against
an enemy, have taken many scalps, and
brought home many prisoners, he does
not appear to feel any extraordinary pleasure
on the occasion; his answer generally
is, “It is well,” and he makes
very little further enquiry about it. On
the contrary, if you inform him that his
children are slain or taken prisoners, he
makes no complaints, he only replies,
“It does not signify;” and probably, for
some time at least, asks not how it happened.</p>

<p class='c000'>This seeming indifference, however,
does not proceed from an entire suppression
of the natural affections; for notwithstanding
they are esteemed savages, I
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span><a id='never'></a>never saw among any other people greater
proofs of parental or filial tenderness; and
although they meet their wives after a
long absence with the Stoical indifference
just mentioned, they are not in general
void of conjugal affection.</p>

<p class='c000'>Another peculiarity is observable in
their manner of paying their visits. If an
Indian goes to visit a particular person in
a family, he mentions to whom his visit
is intended, and the rest of the family
immediately retiring to the other end of
the hut or tent are careful not to come
near enough to interrupt them during the
whole of the conversation. The same method
is pursued if a man goes to pay his
respects to one of the other sex; but then
he must be careful not to let love be the
subject of his discourse whilst the daylight
remains.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians discover an amazing sagacity,
and acquire with the greatest
readiness any thing that depends upon
the attention of the mind. By experience
and an acute observation, they attain many
perfections to which Europeans are strangers.
For instance, they will cross a forest
or a plain which is two hundred
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span>miles in breadth, and reach with great exactness
the point at which they intend to
arrive, keeping during the whole of that
space in a direct line, without any material
deviations; and this they will do with
the same ease, whether the weather be
fair or cloudy.</p>

<p class='c000'>With equal acuteness will they point
to that part of the heavens the sun is in,
though it be intercepted by clouds or fogs.
Besides this, they are able to pursue with
incredible facility the traces of man or
beast, either on leaves or grass; and on
this account it is with great difficulty a
flying enemy escapes discovery.</p>

<p class='c000'>They are indebted for these talents
not only to nature, but to an extraordinary
command of the intellectual faculties,
which can only be acquired by an
unremitted attention, and by long experience.</p>

<p class='c000'>They are in general very happy in a
retentive memory; they can recapitulate
every particular that has been treated of
in council, and remember the exact time
when these were held. Their belts of wampum
preserve the substance of the treaties
they have concluded with the neighbouring
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span>tribes for ages back, to which they
will appeal, and refer with as much perspicuity
and readiness as Europeans can to
their written records.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every nation pays great respect to old
age. The advice of a father will seldom
meet with any extraordinary attention
from the young Indians, probably they
receive it with only a bare assent; but they
will tremble before a grandfather, and submit
to his injunctions with the utmost
alacrity. The words of the ancient part
of their community are esteemed by the
young as oracles. If they take during
their hunting parties any game that is
reckoned by them uncommonly delicious,
it is immediately presented to the oldest of
their relations.</p>

<p class='c000'>They never suffer themselves to be
overburdened with care, but live in a
state of perfect tranquillity and contentment.
Being naturally indolent, if provision
just sufficient for their subsistence
can be procured with little trouble,
and near at hand, they will not go far,
or take any extraordinary pains for it,
though by so doing they might acquire
<span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span>greater plenty and of a more estimable
kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having much leisure time they indulge
this indolence to which they are so prone,
by eating, drinking, or sleeping, and rambling
about in their towns or camps. But
when necessity obliges them to take the
field, either to oppose an enemy, or to
procure themselves food, they are alert and
indefatigable. Many instances of their activity
on these occasions will be given
when I treat of their wars.</p>

<p class='c000'>The infatuating spirit of gaming is
not confined to Europe; the Indians also
feel the bewitching impulse, and often
lose their arms, their apparel, and every
thing they are possessed of. In this case,
however, they do not follow the example
of more refined gamesters, for they
neither murmur nor repine; not a fretful
word escapes them, but they bear the
frowns of fortune with a philosophic composure.</p>

<p class='c000'>The greatest blemish in their character
is that savage disposition which impels
them to treat their enemies with a severity
every other nation shudders at. But
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>if they are thus barbarous to those with
whom they are at war, they are friendly,
hospitable, and humane in peace. It may
with truth be said of them, that they are
the worst enemies, and the best friends,
of any people in the whole world.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians in general are strangers to
the passion of jealousy; and brand a man
with folly that is distrustful of his wife.
Among some bands the very idea is not
known; as the most abandoned of their
young men very rarely attempt the virtue
of married women, nor do these often
put themselves in the way of solicitation.
Yet the Indian women in general are of
an amorous temperature, and before they
are married are not the less esteemed for the
indulgence of their passions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst I was among the Naudowessies
I observed that they paid uncommon respect
to one of their women, and found
on enquiry that she was intitled to it on
account of a transaction, that in Europe
would have rendered her infamous.</p>

<p class='c000'>They told me that when she was a
young woman, for at the time I saw her
she was far advanced in life, she had given
what they termed a rice feast. According
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>to an ancient but almost obsolete
custom (which, as Hamlet says, would
have been more honoured in the breach,
than the observance) she invited forty of
the principal warriors to her tent, where
having feasted them with rice and venison,
she by turns regaled each of them
with a private desert, behind a screen fixed
for this purpose in the inner part of the
tent.</p>

<p class='c000'>She had the happiness to obtain by this
profusion of courtesy, the favour of her
guests, and the approbation of the whole
band. So sensible were the young Indians
of her extraordinary merit, that they
vied with each other for her hand, and
in a very short time one of the principal
chiefs took her to wife, over whom she
acquired great sway, and from whom she
received ever after incessant tokens of respect,
and love.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is however scarcely once in an age
that any of the females are hardy enough
to make this feast, notwithstanding a husband
of the first rank awaits as a sure reward
the successful giver of it; and the
custom, I since find, is peculiar to the
Naudowessies.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>The Indians in their common state are
strangers to all distinction of property, except
in the articles of domestic use, which
every one considers as his own, and increases
as circumstances admit. They are
extremely liberal to each other, and supply
the deficiency of their friends with any superfluity
of their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>In dangers they readily give assistance
to those of their band who stand in need
of it, without any expectation of return,
except of those just rewards that are always
conferred by the Indians on merit.
Governed by the plain and equitable laws
of nature, every one is rewarded solely
according to his deserts; and their equality
of condition, manners, and privileges,
with that constant and sociable familiarity
which prevails throughout every Indian nation,
animates them with a pure and truly
patriotic spirit, that tends to the general
good of the society to which they belong.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any of their neighbours are bereaved
by death or by an enemy of their children,
those who are possessed of the greatest
number of slaves, supply the deficiency;
and these are adopted by them and treated
in every respect as if they really were the
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>children of the person to whom they are
presented.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians, except those who live
adjoining to the European colonies, can
form to themselves no idea of the value
of money; they consider it, when they
are made acquainted with the uses to
which it is applied by other nations,
as the source of innumerable evils. To
it they attribute all the mischiefs that
are prevalent among Europeans, such as
treachery, plundering, devastations, and
murder.</p>

<p class='c000'>They esteem it irrational that one man
should be possessed of a greater quantity
than another, and are amazed that any
honour should be annexed to the possession
of it. But that the want of this
useless metal should be the cause of depriving
persons of their liberty, and that
on account of this partial distribution of it,
great numbers should be immured within
the dreary walls of a prison, cut off
from that society of which they constitute
a part, exceeds their belief. Nor do
they fail, on hearing this part of the European
system of government related, to
charge the institutors of it with a total
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span>want of humanity, and to brand them with
the names of savages and brutes.</p>

<p class='c000'>They shew almost an equal degree of
indifference for the productions of art.
When any of these are shewn them, they
say, “It is pretty, I like to look at it,”
but are not inquisitive about the construction
of it, neither can they form proper
conceptions of its use. But if you tell
them of a person who is able to run with
great agility, that is well skilled in hunting,
can direct with unerring aim a gun,
or bend with ease a bow, that can dexterously
work a canoe, understands the art
of war, is acquainted with the situation of
a country, and can make his way without
a guide, through an immense forest,
subsisting during this on a small quantity
of provisions, they are in raptures; they
listen with great attention to the pleasing
tale, and bestow the highest commendations
on the hero of it.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV.<br /> <br /><i>Their Method of reckoning</i> <span class='sc'>Time</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>CONSIDERING their ignorance of
astronomy, time is very rationally
divided by the Indians. Those in the interior
parts (and of those I would generally
be understood to speak) count their years
by winters; or, as they express themselves,
by snows.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some nations among them reckon their
years by moons, and make them consist
of twelve synodical or lunar months, observing,
when thirty moons have waned,
to add a supernumerary one, which they
term the lost moon; and then begin to
count as before. They pay a great regard
to the first appearance of every moon, and
on the occasion always repeat some joyful
sounds, stretching at the same time their
hands towards it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every month has with them a name
expressive of its season; for instance, they
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span>call the month of March (in which their
year generally begins at the first New
Moon after the vernal Equinox) the
Worm Month or Moon; because at this
time the worms quit their retreats in
the bark of the trees, wood, &amp;c. where
they have sheltered themselves during the
winter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The month of April is termed by
them the month of Plants. May, the
Month of Flowers. June, the Hot
Moon. July, the Buck Moon. Their
reason for thus denominating these is obvious.</p>

<p class='c000'>August, the Sturgeon Moon; because
in this month they catch great numbers of
that fish.</p>

<p class='c000'>September, the Corn Moon; because
in that month they gather in their Indian
Corn.</p>

<p class='c000'>October, the Travelling Moon; as they
leave at this time their villages, and travel
towards the places where they intend to
hunt during the winter.</p>

<p class='c000'>November, the Beaver Moon; for in
this month the beavers begin to take
shelter in their houses, having laid up a
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>sufficient store of provisions for the winter
season.</p>

<p class='c000'>December, the Hunting Moon, because
they employ this month in pursuit of
their game.</p>

<p class='c000'>January, the Cold Moon, as it generally
freezes harder, and the cold is
more intense in this than in any other
month.</p>

<p class='c000'>February they call the Snow Moon,
because more snow commonly falls during
this month, than any other in the
winter.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the moon does not shine they
say the moon is dead; and some call the
three last days of it the naked days. The
moon’s first appearance they term its coming
to life again.</p>

<p class='c000'>They make no division of weeks; but
days they count by sleeps; half days by
pointing to the sun at noon; and quarters
by the rising and the setting of the
sun: to express which in their traditions
they make use of very significant hieroglyphicks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians are totally unskilled in
geography as well as all the other sciences,
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>and yet, as I have before hinted, they
draw on their birch bark very exact charts
or maps of the countries with which they
are acquainted. The latitude and longitude
is only wanting to make them tolerably
complete.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their sole knowledge in astronomy consists
in being able to point out the pole-star;
by which they regulate their course
when they travel in the night.</p>

<p class='c000'>They reckon the distance of places, not
by miles or leagues, but by a day’s journey,
which, according to the best calculations
I could make, appears to be about
twenty English miles. These they also
divide into halves and quarters, and will
demonstrate them in their maps with great
exactness, by the hieroglyphicks just mentioned,
when they regulate in council
their war parties, or their most distant
hunting excursions.</p>

<p class='c000'>They have no idea of arithmetic; and
though they are able to count to any
number, figures as well as letters appear
mysterious to them, and above their comprehension.</p>

<p class='c000'>During my abode with the Naudowessies,
some of the chiefs observing one day
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>a draft of an eclipse of the moon, in a
book of astronomy which I held in my
hand, they desired I would permit them
to look at it. Happening to give them
the book shut, they began to count the
leaves till they came to the place in which
the plate was. After they had viewed
it, and asked many questions relative to
it, I told them they needed not to have
taken so much pains to find the leaf on
which it was drawn, for I could not only
tell in an instant the place, without counting
the leaves, but also how many preceded
it.</p>

<p class='c000'>They seemed greatly amazed at my assertion,
and begged that I would demonstrate
to them the possibility of doing
it. To this purpose I desired the chief
that held the book, to open it at any particular
place, and just shewing me the
page carefully to conceal the edges of the
leaves, so that I might not be able to
count them.</p>

<p class='c000'>This he did with the greatest caution;
notwithstanding which, by looking at the
folio, I told him, to his great surprize,
the number of leaves. He counted them
regularly over, and discovered that I was
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span>exact. And when, after repeated trials,
the Indians found I could do it with
great readiness, and without ever erring
in my calculation, they all seemed as
much astonished as if I had raised the
dead. The only way they could account
for my knowledge, was by concluding
that the book was a spirit, and whispered
me answers to whatever I demanded
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This circumstance, trifling as it might
appear to those who are less illiterate, contributed
to increase my consequence, and
to augment the favourable opinion they
already entertained of me.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V.<br /> <br /><i>Of their</i> <span class='sc'>Government</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>EVERY separate body of Indians is divided
into bands or tribes; which
band or tribe forms a little community
with the nation to which it belongs. As
the nation has some particular symbol by
which it is distinguished from others, so
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span>each tribe has a badge from which it is
denominated: as that of the Eagle, the
Panther, the Tiger, the Buffalo, &amp;c. &amp;c.
One band of the Naudowessie is represented
by a Snake, another a Tortoise, a third a
Squirrel, a fourth a Wolf, and a fifth a
Buffalo. Throughout every nation they
particularize themselves in the same manner,
and the meanest person among them
will remember his lineal descent, and distinguish
himself by his respective family.</p>

<p class='c000'>Did not many circumstances tend to
confute the supposition, I should be almost
induced to conclude from this distinction
of tribes, and the particular attachment
of the Indians to them, that they derive
their origin, as some have asserted, from
the Israelites.</p>

<p class='c000'>Besides this, every nation distinguish
themselves by the manner of constructing
their tents or huts. And so well
versed are all the Indians in this distinction,
that though there appears to be
no difference on the nicest observation
made by an European, yet they will immediately
discover, from the position of a
pole left in the ground, what nation has
<span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span>encamped on the spot many months before.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every band has a chief who is termed
the Great Chief or the chief Warrior; and
who is chosen in consideration of his experience
in war, and of his approved valour,
to direct their military operations, and to
regulate all concerns belonging to that department.
But this chief is not considered
as the head of the state; besides the
great warrior who is elected for his warlike
qualifications, there is another who
enjoys a pre-eminence as his hereditary
right, and has the more immediate management
of their civil affairs. This
chief might with greater propriety be denominated
the Sachem; whose assent is
necessary in all conveyances and treaties,
to which he affixes the mark of the tribe
or nation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though these two are considered as
the heads of the band, and the latter
is usually denominated their king, yet
the Indians are sensible of neither civil
or military subordination. As every one
of them entertains a high opinion of his
consequence, and is extremely tenacious
of his liberty, all injunctions that carry
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>with them the appearance of a positive
command, are instantly rejected with scorn.</p>

<p class='c000'>On this account, it is seldom that their
leaders are so indiscreet as to give out any
of their orders in a peremptory stile; a
bare hint from a chief that he thinks
such a thing necessary to be done, instantly
arouses an emulation among the inferior
ranks, and it is immediately executed
with great alacrity. By this method
the disgustful part of the command
is evaded, and an authority that falls
little short of absolute sway instituted in
its room.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Indians no visible form of
government is established; they allow of
no such distinction as magistrate and subject,
every one appearing to enjoy an independence
that cannot be controlled.
The object of government among them is
rather foreign than domestic, for their attention
seems more to be employed in preserving
such an union among the members
of their tribe as will enable them
to watch the motions of their enemies,
and to act against them with concert and
vigour, than to maintain interior order by
any public regulations. If a scheme that
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span>appears to be of service to the community
is proposed by the chief, every one is at
liberty to chuse whether he will assist in
carrying it on; for they have no compulsory
laws that lay them under any restrictions.
If violence is committed, or blood
is shed, the right of revenging these
misdemeanours are left to the family of
the injured; the chiefs assume neither the
power of inflicting or moderating the punishment.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some nations, where the dignity is hereditary,
limit the succession to the female
line. On the death of a chief, his
sister’s son sometimes succeeds him in preference
to his own son; and if he happens
to have no sister, the nearest female
relation assumes the dignity. This accounts
for a woman being at the head of
the Winnebagoe nation, which, before I
was acquainted with their laws, appeared
strange to me.</p>

<p class='c000'>Each family has a right to appoint one
of its chiefs to be an assistant to the principal
chief, who watches over the interest of
his family, and without whose consent
nothing of a public nature can be carried
into execution. These are generally chosen
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span>for their ability in speaking; and such
only are permitted to make orations in
their councils and general assemblies.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this body, with the hereditary chief
at its head, the supreme authority appears
to be lodged; as by its determination every
transaction relative to their hunting, to
their making war or peace, and to all their
public concerns are regulated. Next to
these, the body of warriors, which comprehends
all that are able to bear arms,
hold their rank. This division has sometimes
at its head the chief of the nation,
if he has signalized himself by any renowned
action, if not, some chief that has
rendered himself famous.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their councils which are held by the
foregoing members, every affair of consequence
is debated; and no enterprize of
the least moment undertaken, unless it
there meets with the general approbation
of the chiefs. They commonly assemble
in a hut or tent appropriated to this purpose,
and being seated in a circle on the
ground, the eldest chief rises and makes a
speech; when he has concluded, another
gets up; and thus they all speak, if necessary,
by turns.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span>On this occasion their language is nervous,
and their manner of expression, emphatical.
Their style is adorned with images,
comparisons, and strong metaphors,
and is equal in allegories to that of any of
the eastern nations. In all their set speeches
they express themselves with much vehemence,
but in common discourse according
to our usual method of speech.</p>

<p class='c000'>The young men are suffered to be present
at the councils, though they are not
allowed to make a speech till they are regularly
admitted: they however listen with
great attention, and to shew that they
both understand, and approve of the resolutions
taken by the assembled chiefs,
they frequently exclaim, “That is right.”
“That is good.”</p>

<p class='c000'>The customary mode among all the
ranks of expressing their assent, and which
they repeat at the end of almost every
period, is by uttering a kind of forcible
aspiration, which sounds like an union of
the letters OAH.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI.<br /> <br /><i>Of their</i> <span class='sc'>Feasts</span>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>MANY of the Indian nations neither
make use of bread, salt, or spices;
and some of them have never seen or
tasted of either. The Naudowessies in particular
have no bread, nor any substitute
for it. They eat the wild rice which grows
in great quantities in different parts of
their territories; but they boil it and eat
it alone. They also eat the flesh of the
beasts they kill, without having recourse
to any farinaceous substance to absorb the
grosser particles of it. And even when
they consume the sugar which they have
extracted from the maple tree, they use it
not to render some other food palatable,
but generally eat it by itself.</p>

<p class='c000'>Neither have they any idea of the use
of milk, although they might collect great
quantities from the buffalo or the elk;
they only consider it as proper for the nutriment
of the young of these beasts during
their tender state. I could not perceive
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>that any inconveniency attended the
total disuse of articles esteemed so necessary
and nutritious by other nations, on
the contrary, they are in general healthy
and vigorous.</p>

<p class='c000'>One dish however, which answers nearly
the same purpose as bread, is in use
among the Ottagaumies, the Saukies, and
the more eastern nations, where Indian
corn grows, which is not only much esteemed
by them, but it is reckoned extremely
palatable by all the Europeans who enter
their dominions. This is composed of
their unripe corn as before described, and
beans in the same state, boiled together
with bears flesh, the fat of which moistens
the pulse, and renders it beyond comparison
delicious. They call this food
Succatosh.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians are far from being canibals,
as they are said to be. All their
victuals are either roasted or boiled; and
this in the extreme. Their drink is generally
the broth in which it has been
boiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their food consists of the flesh of the
bear, the buffalo, the elk, the deer, the
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span>beaver, and the racoon; which they prepare
in the manner just mentioned. They
usually eat the flesh of the deer which is
naturally dry, with that of the bear which
is fat and juicy; and though the latter
is extremely rich and luscious, it is never
known to cloy.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the spring of the year the Naudowessies
eat the inside bark of a shrub,
that they gather in some part of their
country; but I could neither learn the
name of it, or discover from whence they
got it. It was of a brittle nature and easily
masticated. The taste of it was very
agreeable, and they said it was extremely
nourishing. In flavour it was not unlike
the turnip, and when received into the
mouth resembled that root both in its pulpous
and frangible nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>The lower ranks of the Indians are
exceedingly nasty in dressing their victuals,
but some of the chiefs are very neat
and cleanly in their apparel, tents, and
food.</p>

<p class='c000'>They commonly eat in large parties, so
that their meals may properly be termed
feasts; and this they do without being restricted
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>to any fixed or regular hours, but
just as their appetites require, and convenience
suits.</p>

<p class='c000'>They usually dance either before or after
every meal; and by this cheerfulness probably
render the Great Spirit, to whom
they consider themselves as indebted for
every good, a more acceptable sacrifice
than a formal and unanimated thanksgiving.
The men and women feast apart:
and each sex invite by turns their companions
to partake with them of the food
they happen to have; but in their domestic
way of living the men and women
eat together.</p>

<p class='c000'>No people are more hospitable, kind,
and free than the Indians. They will
readily share with any of their own tribe
the last part of their provisions, and even
with those of a different nation, if they
chance to come in when they are eating.
Though they do not keep one common
stock, yet that community of goods which
is so prevalent among them, and their generous
disposition, render it nearly of the
same effect.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the chiefs are convened on any
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>public business, they always conclude with
a feast, at which their festivity and cheerfulness
knows no limits.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII.<br /> <br /><i>Of their</i> <span class='sc'>Dances</span>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>DANCING is a favourite exercise
among the Indians; they never meet
on any public occasion, but this makes
a part of the entertainment. And when
they are not engaged in war or hunting,
the youth of both sexes amuse themselves
in this manner every evening.</p>

<p class='c000'>They always dance, as I have just observed,
at their feast. In these as well
as all their other dances, every man rises
in his turn, and moves about with great
freedom and boldness; singing as he does
so, the exploits of his ancestors. During
this the company, who are seated on the
ground in a circle, around the dancer,
join with him in marking the cadence,
by an odd tone, which they utter all together,
and which sounds, “Heh, heh,
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span>heh.” These notes, if they might be
so termed, are articulated with a harsh accent,
and strained out with the utmost
force of their lungs; so that one would
imagine their strength must be soon exhausted
by it; instead of which, they repeat
it with the same violence during the
whole of their entertainment.</p>

<p class='c000'>The women, particularly those of the
western nations, dance very gracefully.
They carry themselves erect, and with
their arms hanging down close to their
sides, move first a few yards to the right,
and then back again to the left. This
movement they perform without taking
any steps as an European would do, but
with their feet conjoined, moving by turns
their toes and heels. In this manner
they glide with great agility to a certain
distance, and then return; and let those
who join in the dance be ever so numerous,
they keep time so exactly with each
other that no interruption ensues. During
this, at stated periods they mingle
their shrill voices with the hoarser ones
of the men who sit around (for it is to be
observed that the sexes never intermix in
the same dance) which, with the music
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span>of the drums and chichicoues, make an
agreeable harmony.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians have several kinds of
dances which they use on different occasions,
as the Pipe or Calumate Dance,
the War Dance, the Marriage Dance, and
the Dance of the Sacrifice. The movements
in every one of these are dissimilar;
but it is almost impossible to convey
any idea of the points in which they are
unlike.</p>

<p class='c000'>Different nations likewise vary in their
manner of dancing. The Chipéways
throw themselves into a greater variety
of attitudes than any other people; sometimes
they hold their heads erect, at
others they bend them almost to the
ground; then recline on one side, and
immediately after on the other. The
Naudowessies carry themselves more upright,
step firmer, and move more gracefully.
But they all accompany their
dances with the disagreeable noise just
mentioned.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pipe Dance is the principal, and
the most pleasing to a spectator of any
of them, being the least frantic, and the
movement of it the most graceful. It
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span>is but on particular occasions that it is
used; as when ambassadors from an enemy
arrive to treat of peace, or when
strangers of eminence pass through their
territories.</p>

<p class='c000'>The War Dance, which they use both
before they set out on their war parties,
and on their return from them, strikes
terror into strangers. It is performed, as
the others, amidst a circle of the warriors;
a chief generally begins it, who
moves from the right to the left, singing
at the same time both his own exploits,
and those of his ancestors. When he has
concluded his account of any memorable
action, he gives a violent blow with his
war-club against a post that is fixed in
the ground, near the center of the assembly,
for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one dances in his turn, and recapitulates
the wondrous deeds of his family,
till they all at last join in the dance.
Then it becomes truly alarming to any
stranger that happens to be among them,
as they throw themselves into every horrible
and terrifying posture that can be
imagined, rehearsing at the same time the
parts they expect to act against their enemies
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>in the field. During this they hold
their sharp knives in their hands, with
which, as they whirl about, they are
every moment in danger of cutting each
others throats; and did they not shun
the threatened mischief with inconceivable
dexterity, it could not be avoided. By
these motions they intend to represent the
manner in which they kill, scalp, and
take their prisoners. To heighten the
scene, they set up the same hideous yells,
cries, and war-hoops they use in time
of action: so that it is impossible to consider
them in any other light than as an
assembly of demons.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have frequently joined in this dance
with them, but it soon ceased to be an
amusement to me, as I could not lay
aside my apprehensions of receiving some
dreadful wound, that from the violence
of their gestures must have proved mortal.</p>

<p class='c000'>I found that the nations to the westward
of the Mississippi, and on the borders
of Lake Superior, still continue to
make use of the Pawwaw or Black Dance.
The people of the colonies tell a thousand
ridiculous stories of the devil being
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span>raised in this dance by the Indians. But
they allow that this was in former times,
and is now nearly extinct among those
who live adjacent to the European settlements.
However I discovered that it
was still used in the interior parts; and
though I did not actually see the devil
raised by it, I was witness to some scenes
that could only be performed by such as
dealt with him, or were very expert and
dextrous jugglers.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst I was among the Naudowessies,
a dance, which they thus termed, was
performed. Before the dance began, one
of the Indians was admitted into a society
which they denominated Wakon-Kitchewah,
that is, the Friendly Society of
the Spirit. This society is composed of
persons of both sexes, but such only can
be admitted into it as are of unexceptionable
character, and who receive the approbation
of the whole body. To this admission
succeeded the Pawwaw Dance (in
which I saw nothing that could give rise
to the reports I had heard) and the whole,
according to their usual custom, concluded
with a grand feast.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>The initiation being attended with some
very singular circumstances, which, as I
have before observed, must be either the
effect of magic, or of amazing dexterity,
I shall give a particular account of the
whole procedure. It was performed at the
time of the new moon, in a place appropriated
to the purpose near the centre of
their camp, that would contain about two
hundred people. Being a stranger, and
on all occasions treated by them with
great civility, I was invited to see the ceremony,
and placed close to the rails of
the inclosure.</p>

<p class='c000'>About twelve o’clock they began to
assemble; when the sun shone bright,
which they considered as a good omen,
for they never by choice hold any of
their public meetings unless the sky be
clear and unclouded. A great number of
chiefs first appeared, who were dressed in
their best apparel; and after them came
the head-warrior, clad in a long robe of
rich furs that trailed on the ground, attended
by a retinue of fifteen or twenty
persons, painted and dressed in the gayest
manner. Next followed the wives of
such as had been already admitted into
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>the society; and in the rear a confused
heap of the lower ranks, all contributing
as much as lay in their power to make
the appearance grand and showy.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the assembly was seated, and
silence proclaimed, one of the principal
chiefs arose, and in a short but masterly
speech informed his audience of the occasion
of their meeting. He acquainted them
that one of their young men wished to
be admitted into their society; and taking
him by the hand presented him to their
view, asking them, at the same time,
whether they had any objection to his becoming
one of their community.</p>

<p class='c000'>No objection being made, the young
candidate was placed in the centre, and
four of the chiefs took their stations close
to him; after exhorting him, by turns,
not to faint under the operation he was
about to go through, but to behave like
an Indian and a man, two of them took
hold of his arms, and caused him to
kneel; another placed himself behind him
so as to receive him when he fell, and
the last of the four retired to the distance
of about twelve feet from him exactly in
front.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span>This disposition being completed, the
chief that stood before the kneeling candidate,
began to speak to him with an
audible voice. He told him that he himself
was now agitated by the same spirit
which he should in a few moments communicate
to him; that it would strike
him dead, but that he would instantly be
restored again to life; to this he added,
that the communication, however terrifying,
was a necessary introduction to the
advantages enjoyed by the community
into which he was on the point of being
admitted.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he spoke this, he appeared to be
greatly agitated; till at last his emotions
became so violent, that his countenance
was distorted, and his whole frame convulsed.
At this juncture he threw something
that appeared both in shape and colour
like a small bean, at the young man,
which seemed to enter his mouth, and
he instantly fell as motionless as if he
had been shot. The chief that was placed
behind him received him in his arms,
and, by the assistance of the other two,
laid him on the ground to all appearance
bereft of life.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span>Having done this, they immediately
began to rub his limbs, and to strike him
on the back, giving him such blows, as
seemed more calculated to still the quick,
than to raise the dead. During these extraordinary
applications, the speaker continued
his harangue, desiring the spectators
not to be surprized, or to despair of
the young man’s recovery, as his present
inanimate situation proceeded only from
the forcible operation of the spirit, on
faculties that had hitherto been unused to
inspirations of this kind.</p>

<p class='c000'>The candidate lay several minutes without
sense or motion; but at length, after
receiving many violent blows, he began
to discover some symptoms of returning
life. These, however, were attended
with strong convulsions, and an
apparent obstruction in his throat. But
they were soon at an end; for having discharged
from his mouth the bean, or
whatever it was that the chief had thrown
at him, but which on the closest inspection
I had not perceived to enter it, he
soon after appeared to be tolerably recovered.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span>This part of the ceremony being happily
effected, the officiating chiefs disrobed
him of the cloaths he had usually worn,
and put on him a set of apparel entirely
new. When he was dressed, the speaker
once more took him by the hand, and
presented him to the society as a regular
and thoroughly initiated member, exhorting
them, at the same time, to give him
such necessary assistance, as being a young
member, he might stand in need of. He
then also charged the newly elected brother
to receive with humility, and to follow
with punctuality the advice of his
elder brethren.</p>

<p class='c000'>All those who had been admitted within
the rails, now formed a circle around
their new brother, and the music striking
up, the great chief sung a song, celebrating
as usual their martial exploits.</p>

<p class='c000'>The only music they make use of is a
drum, which is composed of a piece of
a hollow tree curiously wrought, and
over one end of which is strained a skin,
this they beat with a single stick, and it
gives a sound that is far from harmonious,
but it just serves to beat time with.
To this they sometimes add the chichicoe,
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span>and in their war dances they likewise use
a kind of fife, formed of a reed, which
makes a shrill harsh noise.</p>

<p class='c000'>The whole assembly were by this time
united, and the dance began; several singers
assisted the music with their voices,
and the women joining in the chorus at
certain intervals, they produced together
a not unpleasing but savage harmony.
This was one of the most agreeable entertainments
I saw whilst I was among
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could not help laughing at a singular
childish custom I observed they introduced
into this dance, and which was the
only one that had the least appearance of
conjuration. Most of the members carried
in their hands an otter or martin’s
skin, which being taken whole from the
body, and filled with wind, on being compressed
made a squeaking noise through
a small piece of wood organically formed
and fixed in its mouth. When this instrument
was presented to the face of any
of the company, and the sound emitted,
the person receiving it instantly fell down
to appearance dead. Sometimes two or
three, both men and women, were on
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span>the ground together; but immediately recovering,
they rose up and joined again
in the dance. This seemed to afford,
even the chiefs themselves, infinite diversion.
I afterwards learned that these were
their Dii Penates or Houshold Gods.</p>

<p class='c000'>After some hours spent in this manner
the feast began; the dishes being brought
near me, I perceived that they consisted
of dog’s flesh; and I was informed that
at all their public grand feasts they never
made use of any other kind of food.
For this purpose, at the feast I am now
speaking of, the new candidate provides
fat dogs, if they can be procured at any
price.</p>

<p class='c000'>In this custom of eating dog’s flesh on
particular occasions, they resemble the inhabitants
of some of the countries that lie
on the north-east borders of Asia. The
author of the account of Kamschatka,
published by order of the Empress of Russia
(before referred to) informs us, that
the people inhabiting Koreka, a country
north of Kamschatka, who wander about
in hords like the Arabs, when they pay
their worship to the evil beings, kill a
rein-deer or a dog, the flesh of which
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>they eat, and leave the head and tongue
sticking on a pole with the front towards
the east. Also that when they are afraid
of any infectious distemper, they kill a
dog, and winding the guts about two
poles, pass between them. These customs,
in which they are nearly imitated
by the Indians, seem to add strength to
my supposition, that America was first
peopled from this quarter.</p>

<p class='c000'>I know not under what class of dances
to rank that performed by the Indians
who came to my tent when I landed near
Lake Pepin, on the banks of the Mississippi,
as related in my Journals. When
I looked out, as I there mentioned, I saw
about twenty naked young Indians, the
most perfect in their shape, and by far
the handsomest of any I had ever seen,
coming towards me, and dancing as they
approached, to the music of their drums.
At every ten or twelve yards they halted,
and set up their yells and cries.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they reached my tent, I asked
them to come in; which, without deigning
to make me any answer, they did. As
I observed that they were painted red <a id='and'></a>and
black, as they usually are when they
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span>go against an enemy, and perceived that
some parts of the war-dance were intermixed
with their other movements, I
doubted not but they were set on by the
inimical chief who had refused my salutation:
I therefore determined to sell my
life as dear as possible. To this purpose,
I received them sitting on my chest,
with my gun and pistols beside me, and
ordered my men to keep a watchful eye
on them, and to be also upon their
guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians being entered, they continued
their dance alternately, singing at
the same time of their heroic exploits,
and the superiority of their race over
every other people. To enforce their
language, though it was uncommonly
nervous and expressive, and such as would
of itself have carried terror to the firmest
heart, at the end of every period they
struck their war-clubs against the poles of
my tent, with such violence, that I expected
every moment it would have tumbled
upon us. As each of them, in
dancing round, passed by me, they placed
their right hands over their eyes, and
coming close to me, looked me steadily
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span>in the face, which I could not construe
into a token of friendship. My men
gave themselves up for lost, and I acknowledge,
for my own part, that I never
found my apprehensions more tumultuous
on any occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they had nearly ended their
dance, I presented to them the pipe of
peace, but they would not receive it. I
then, as my last resource, thought I
would try what presents would do; accordingly
I took from my chest some
ribands and trinkets, which I laid before
them. These seemed to stagger their resolutions,
and to avert in some degree
their anger; for after holding a consultation
together, they sat down on the
ground, which I considered as a favourable
omen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Thus it proved, as in a short time
they received the pipe of peace, and lighting
it, first presented it to me, and then
smoaked with it themselves. Soon after
they took up the presents, which had hitherto
lain neglected, and appearing to be
greatly pleased with them, departed in a
friendly manner. And never did I receive
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>greater pleasure than at getting rid of such
formidable guests.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was not ever in my power to gain a
thorough knowledge of the designs of my
visiters. I had sufficient reason to conclude
that they were hostile, and that
their visit, at so late an hour, was made
through the instigation of the Grand
Sautor; but I was afterwards informed
that it might be intended as a compliment
which they usually pay to the chiefs of
every other nation who happen to fall in
with them, and that the circumstances in
their conduct, which had appeared so suspicious
to me, were merely the effects of
their vanity, and designed to impress on
the minds of those whom they thus visited
an elevated opinion of their valour and
prowess. In the morning before I continued
my route, several of their wives
brought me a present of some sugar, for
whom I found a few more ribands.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Dance of the sacrifice is not so
denominated from their offering up at the
same time a sacrifice to any good or evil
spirit, but is a dance to which the Naudowessies
give that title from being used
when any public fortunate circumstance
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span>befalls them. Whilst I resided among
them, a fine large deer accidentally strayed
into the middle of their encampment,
which they soon destroyed. As this happened
just at the new moon, they esteemed
it a lucky omen; and having
roasted it whole, every one in the camp
partook of it. After their feast, they all
joined in a dance, which they termed,
from its being somewhat of a religious
nature, a Dance of the sacrifice.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII.<br /> <br /><i>Of their</i> <span class='sc'>Hunting</span>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>HUNTING is the principal occupation
of the Indians; they are
trained to it from their earliest youth, and
it is an exercise which is esteemed no less
honourable than necessary towards their
subsistence. A dextrous and resolute hunter
is held nearly in as great estimation
by them as a distinguished warrior.
Scarcely any device which the ingenuity
of man has discovered for ensnaring or destroying
those animals that supply them
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span>with food, or whose skins are valuable to
Europeans, is unknown to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst they are engaged in this exercise,
they shake off the indolence peculiar
to their nature, and become active, persevering,
and indefatigable. They are
equally sagacious in finding their prey,
and in the means they use to destroy it.
They discern the footsteps of the beasts
they are in pursuit of, although they are
imperceptible to every other eye, and can
follow them with certainty through the
pathless forest.</p>

<p class='c000'>The beasts that the Indians hunt, both
for their flesh on which they subsist, and
for their skins, of which they either make
their apparel, or barter with the Europeans
for necessaries, are the buffalo, the
elk, the deer, the moose, the carribboo,
the bear, the beaver, the otter, the martin,
&amp;c. I defer giving a description of these
creatures here, and shall only at present
treat of their manner of hunting them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The route they shall take for this purpose,
and the parties that shall go on the
different expeditions are fixed in their general
councils which are held some time
in the summer, when all the operations
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span>for the ensuing winter are concluded on.
The chief-warrior, whose province it is
to regulate their proceedings on this occasion,
with great solemnity issues out an
invitation to those who choose to attend
him; for the Indians, as before observed,
acknowledge no superiority, nor have they
any idea of compulsion; and every one
that accepts it prepares himself by fasting
during several days.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians do not fast as some other
nations do, on the richest and most luxurious
food, but they totally abstain from
every kind either of victuals or drink; and
such is their patience and resolution, that
the most extreme thirst could not oblige
them to taste a drop of water; yet amidst
this severe abstinence they appear cheerful
and happy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reasons they give for thus fasting,
are, that it enables them freely to dream,
in which dreams they are informed where
they shall find the greatest plenty of game;
and also that it averts the displeasure of
the evil spirits, and induces them to be
propitious. They also on these occasions
blacken those parts of their bodies that are
uncovered.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span>The fast being ended, and the place of
hunting made known, the chief who is
to conduct them, gives a grand feast to
those who are to form the different parties;
of which none of them dare to partake
till they have bathed themselves. At
this feast, notwithstanding they have fasted
so long, they eat with great moderation;
and the chief that presides employs himself
in rehearsing the feats of those who
have been most successful in the business
they are about to enter upon. They soon
after set out on the march towards the
place appointed, painted or rather bedaubed
with black, amidst the acclamations
of all the people.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is impossible to describe their agility
or perseverance, whilst they are in pursuit
of their prey; neither thickets, ditches,
torrents, pools, or rivers stop them;
they always go strait forward in the most
direct line they possibly can, and there
are few of the savage inhabitants of the
woods that they cannot overtake.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they hunt for bears, they endeavour
to find out their retreats; for,
during the winter, these animals conceal
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span>themselves in the hollow trunks of trees,
or make themselves holes in the ground,
where they continue without food, whilst
the severe weather lasts.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Indians think they have arrived
at a place where these creatures usually
haunt, they form themselves into a
circle according to their number, and
moving onward, endeavour, as they advance
towards the centre, to discover the
retreats of their prey. By this means, if
any lie in the intermediate space, they are
sure of arousing them, and bringing them
down either with their bows or their
guns. The bears will take to flight at
sight of a man or a dog, and will only
make resistance when they are extremely
hungry, or after they are wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indian method of hunting the
buffalo is by forming a circle or a square,
nearly in the same manner as when they
search for the bear. Having taken their
different stations, they set the grass, which
at this time is rank and dry, on fire, and
these animals, who are extremely fearful
of that element, flying with precipitation
before it, great numbers are hemmed in
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span>a small compass, and scarcely a single one
escapes.</p>

<p class='c000'>They have different ways of hunting
the elk, the deer, and the carribboo.
Sometimes they seek them out in the
woods, to which they retire during the
severity of the cold, where they are easily
shot from behind the trees. In the more
northern climates they take the advantage
of the weather to destroy the elk; when
the sun has just strength enough to melt
the snow, and the frost in the night forms
a kind of crust on the surface, this creature
being heavy, breaks it with his forked
hoofs, and with difficulty extricates himself
from it: at this time therefore he is
soon overtaken and destroyed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some nations have a method of hunting
these animals which is more easily
executed, and free from danger. The
hunting party divide themselves into two
bands, and choosing a spot near the borders
of some river, one party embarks on
board their canoes, whilst the other forming
themselves into a semi-circle on the
land, the flanks of which reach the shore,
let loose their dogs, and by this means
rouse all the game that lies within these
<span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span>bounds; they then drive them towards
the river, into which they no sooner enter,
than the greatest part of them are immediately
dispatched by those who remain in
the canoes.</p>

<p class='c000'>Both the elk and the buffalo are very
furious when they are wounded, and will
return fiercely on their pursuers, and
trample them under their feet, if the
hunter finds not means to complete their
destruction, or seeks for security in flight
to some adjacent tree; by this method
they are frequently avoided, and so tired
with the pursuit, that they voluntarily give
it over.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the hunting in which the Indians,
particularly those who inhabit the northern
parts, chiefly employ themselves, and
from which they reap the greatest advantage,
is the beaver hunting. The season
for this is throughout the whole of the
winter, from November to April; during
which time the fur of these creatures is in
the greatest perfection. A description of
this extraordinary animal, the construction
of their huts, and the regulations of
their almost rational community, I shall
give in another place.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>The hunters make use of several methods
to destroy them. Those generally
practised, are either that of taking them in
snares, cutting through the ice, or opening
their causeways.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the eyes of these animals are very
quick, and their hearing exceedingly acute,
great precaution is necessary in approaching
their abodes; for as they seldom go far
from the water, and their houses are always
built close to the side of some large
river or lake, or dams of their own constructing,
upon the least alarm they hasten
to the deepest part of the water, and dive
immediately to the bottom; as they do
this they make a great noise by beating
the water with their tails, on purpose to
put the whole fraternity on their guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>They take them with snares in the
following manner: though the beavers usually
lay up a sufficient store of provision
to serve for their subsistence during the
winter, they make from time to time excursions
to the neighbouring woods to procure
further supplies of food. The hunters
having found out their haunts, place
a trap in their way, baited with small
pieces of bark, or young shoots of trees,
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span>which the beaver has no sooner laid hold
of, than a large log of wood falls upon
him, and breaks his back; his enemies,
who are upon the watch, soon appear, and
instantly dispatch the helpless animal.</p>

<p class='c000'>At other times, when the ice on the
rivers and lakes is about half a foot thick,
they make an opening through it with
their hatchets, to which the beavers will
soon hasten, on being disturbed at their
houses, for a supply of fresh air. As
their breath occasions a considerable motion
in the waters, the hunter has sufficient
notice of their approach, and methods
are easily taken for knocking them
on the head the moment they appear above
the surface.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the houses of the beavers happen
to be near a rivulet, they are more easily
destroyed: the hunters then cut the ice,
and spreading a net under it, break down
the cabins of the beavers, who never fail
to make towards the deepest part, where
they are entangled and taken. But they
must not be suffered to remain there long,
as they would soon extricate themselves
with their teeth, which are well known
to be excessively sharp and strong.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span>The Indians take great care to hinder
their dogs from touching the bones of the
beavers. The reasons they give for these
precautions, are, first that the bones are so
excessively hard, that they spoil the teeth
of the dogs; and, secondly, that they
are apprehensive they shall so exasperate
the spirits of the beavers by this permission,
as to render the next hunting season
unsuccessful.</p>

<p class='c000'>The skins of these animals the hunters
exchange with the Europeans for necessaries,
and as they are more valued by the
latter than any other kind of furs, they
pay the greatest attention to this species
of hunting.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Indians destroy buffalos, elks,
deer, &amp;c. they generally divide the flesh of
such as they have taken among the tribe
to which they belong. But in hunting
the beaver a few families usually unite
and divide the spoil between them. Indeed,
in the first instance they generally
pay some attention in the division to their
own families; but no jealousies or murmurings
are ever known to arise on account
of any apparent partiality.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>Among the Naudowessies, if a person
shoots a deer, buffalo, &amp;c. and it runs
to a considerable distance before it drops,
where a person belonging to another tribe,
being nearer, first sticks a knife into it,
the game is considered as the property
of the latter, notwithstanding it had
been mortally wounded by the former.
Though this custom appears to be arbitrary
and unjust, yet that people cheerfully
submit to it. This decision is, however,
very different from that practised
by the Indians on the back of the colonies,
where the first person that hits it is
entitled to the best share.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX.<br /> <br /><i>Of their Manner of making</i> <span class='sc'>War</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>THE Indians begin to bear arms at
the age of fifteen, and lay them
aside when they arrive at the age of sixty.
Some nations to the southward, I have
been informed, do not continue their military
exercises after they are fifty.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span>In every band or nation there is a select
number who are stiled the Warriors, and
who are always ready to act either offensively
or defensively, as occasion requires.
These are well armed, bearing the weapons
commonly in use among them, which
vary according to the situation of their
countries. Such as have an intercourse
with the Europeans make use of tomahawks,
knives, and fire-arms; but those
whose dwellings are situated to the westward
of the Mississippi, and who have not
an opportunity of purchasing these kinds
of weapons, use bows and arrows, and
also the Cassé Tête or War-club.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians that inhabit still farther to
the westward, a country which extends to
the South Sea, use in fight a warlike instrument
that is very uncommon. Having
great plenty of horses, they always
attack their enemies on horseback, and encumber
themselves with no other weapon,
than a stone of a middling size, curiously
wrought, which they fasten by
a string, about a yard and half long, to
their right arms, a little above the elbow.
These stones they conveniently carry in
their hands till they reach their enemies,
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>and then swinging them with great dexterity,
as they ride full speed, never fail
of doing execution. The country which
these tribes possess, abounding with large
extensive plains, those who attack them
seldom return; as the swiftness of the
horses on which they are mounted, enables
them to overtake even the fleetest of
their invaders.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Naudowessies, who had been at
war with this people, informed me, that
unless they found morasses or thickets to
which they could retire, they were sure
of being cut off: to prevent this they
always took care whenever they made
an onset, to do it near such retreats as
were impassable for cavalry, they then
having a great advantage over their enemies,
whose weapons would not there
reach them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some nations make use of a javelin
pointed with bone worked into different
forms; but their Indian weapons in general
are bows and arrows, and the short
club already mentioned. The latter is
made of a very hard wood, and the head
of it fashioned round like a ball, about
three inches and a half diameter; in this
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>rotund part is fixed an edge resembling
that of a tomahawk, either of steel or flint,
whichever they can procure; similar to
that represented in <a href='#weapons'>Plate N<sup>o</sup> IV</a>.</p>

<p class='c000'>The dagger placed near it in the same
plate, is peculiar to the Naudowessie nation,
and of ancient construction, but they
can give no account how long it has been
in use among them. It was originally
made of flint or bone, but since they
have had communication with the European
traders, they have formed it of steel.
The length of it is about ten inches, and
that part close to the handle nearly three
inches broad. Its edges are keen, and it
gradually tapers towards a point. They
wear it in a sheath made of deer’s leather,
neatly ornamented with porcupine quills;
and it is usually hung by a string, decorated
in the same manner, which reaches
as low only as the breast. This curious
weapon is worn by a few of the principal
chiefs alone, and considered both as an
useful instrument, and an ornamental badge
of superiority.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>I observed among the Naudowessies a
few targets or shields made of raw buffalo
hides, and in the form of those used by
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span>the ancients. But as the number of these
was small, and I could gain no intelligence
of the æra in which they first were
introduced among them, I suppose those
I saw had descended from father to son for
many generations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reasons the Indians give for making
war against one another, are much
the same as those urged by more civilized
nations for disturbing the tranquillity of
their neighbours. The pleas of the former
are however in general more rational
and just, than such as are brought by
Europeans in vindication of their proceedings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The extension of empire is seldom a
motive with these people to invade, and
to commit depredations on the territories
of those who happen to dwell near them.
To secure the rights of hunting within
particular limits, to maintain the liberty
of passing through their accustomed
tracks, and to guard those lands which
they consider from a long tenure as their
own, against any infringement, are the
general causes of those dissensions that so
often break out between the Indian nations,
and which are carried on with so
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span>much animosity. Though strangers to
the idea of separate property, yet the most
uncultivated among them are well acquainted
with the rights of their community
to the domains they possess, and
oppose with vigour every encroachment on
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding it is generally supposed
that from their territories being so
extensive, the boundaries of them cannot
be ascertained, yet I am well assured that
the limits of each nation in the interior
parts are laid down in their rude plans
with great precision. By theirs, as I have
before observed, was I enabled to regulate
my own; and after the most exact observations
and enquiries found very few instances
in which they erred.</p>

<p class='c000'>But interest is not either the most frequent
or most powerful incentive to their
making war on each other. The passion
of revenge, which is the distinguishing
characteristic of these people, is the most
general motive. Injuries are felt by them
with exquisite sensibility, and vengeance
pursued with unremitted ardour. To
this may be added, that natural excitation
which every Indian becomes sensible
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span>of as soon as he approaches the age of
manhood to give proofs of his valour and
prowess.</p>

<p class='c000'>As they are early possessed with a notion
that war ought to be the chief business
of their lives, that there is nothing
more desirous than the reputation of being
a great warrior, and that the scalps of
their enemies or a number of prisoners are
alone to be esteemed valuable, it is not to
be wondered at that the younger Indians
are continually restless and uneasy if their
ardour is repressed, and they are kept in
a state of inactivity. Either of these propensities,
the desire of revenge, or the gratification
of an impulse that by degrees
becomes habitual to them, is sufficient,
frequently, to induce them to commit
hostilities on some of the neighbouring
nations.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the chiefs find any occasion for
making war, they endeavour to arouse
these habitudes, and by that means soon
excite their warriors to take arms. To
this purpose they make use of their martial
eloquence nearly in the following
words, which never fails of proving effectual:
“The bones of our deceased
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>countrymen lie uncovered, they call
out to us to revenge their wrongs,
and we must satisfy their request.
Their spirits cry out against us, they
must be appeased. The genii, who
are the guardians of our honour,
inspire us with a resolution to seek
the enemies of our murdered brothers.
Let us go and devour those by
whom they were slain. Sit therefore
no longer inactive, give way to the
impulse of your natural valour, anoint
your hair, paint your faces, fill your
quivers, cause the forests to resound
with your songs, console the spirits of
the dead, and tell them they shall be
revenged.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Animated by these exhortations the
warriors snatch their arms in a transport
of fury, sing the song of war, and burn
with impatience to imbrue their hands in
the blood of their enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes private chiefs assemble small
parties, and make excursions against those
with whom they are at war, or such as
have injured them. A single warrior,
prompted by revenge or a desire to show
his prowess, will march unattended for
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>several hundred miles, to surprize and cut
off a straggling party.</p>

<p class='c000'>These irregular sallies, however, are
not always approved of by the elder
chiefs, though they are often obliged to
connive at them; as in the instance before
given of the Naudowessie and Chipéway
nations.</p>

<p class='c000'>But when a war is national, and undertaken
by the community, their deliberations
are formal and slow. The elders
assemble in council, to which all the
head warriors and young men are admitted,
where they deliver their opinions
in solemn speeches, weighing with maturity
the nature of the enterprize they
are about to engage in, and balancing
with great sagacity the advantages or inconveniences
that will arise from it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their priests are also consulted on the
subject, and even, sometimes, the advice
of the most intelligent of their women is
asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the determination be for war, they
prepare for it with much ceremony.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief warrior of a nation does not
on all occasions head the war party himself,
he frequently deputes a warrior of
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span>whose valour and prudence he has a good
opinion. The person thus fixed on being
first bedawbed with black, observes a fast
of several days, during which he invokes
the Great Spirit, or deprecates the anger
of the evil ones, holding whilst it lasts
no converse with any of his tribe.</p>

<p class='c000'>He is particularly careful at the same
time to observe his dreams, for on these
do they suppose their success will in a
great measure depend; and from the firm
persuasion every Indian actuated by his
own presumptuous thoughts is impressed
with, that he shall march forth to certain
victory, these are generally favourable to
his wishes.</p>

<p class='c000'>After he has fasted as long as custom
prescribes, he assembles the warriors, and
holding a belt of wampum in his hand
thus addresses them:</p>

<p class='c000'>“Brothers! by the inspiration of the
Great Spirit I now speak unto you,
and by him am I prompted to carry
into execution the intentions which I
am about to disclose to you. The
blood of our deceased brothers is not
yet wiped away; their bodies are not
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>yet covered, and I am going to perform
this duty to them.”</p>

<p class='c000'>Having then made known to them all
the motives that induce him to take up
arms against the nation with whom they
are to engage, he thus proceeds: “I have
therefore resolved to march through
the war-path to surprize them. We
will eat their flesh and drink their
blood; we will take scalps, and make
prisoners; and should we perish in
this glorious enterprize, we shall not
be for ever hid in the dust, for this
belt shall be a recompence to him who
buries the dead.” Having said this,
he lays the belt on the ground, and he
who takes it up declares himself his lieutenant,
and is considered as the second in
command; this, however, is only done
by some distinguished warrior who has a
right, by the number of his scalps, to
the post.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though the Indians thus assert that
they will eat the flesh and drink the
blood of their enemies, the threat is only
to be considered as a figurative expression.
Notwithstanding they sometimes devour
the hearts of those they slay, and drink
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span>their blood, by way of bravado, or to
gratify in a more complete manner their
revenge, yet they are not naturally anthropophagi,
nor ever feed on the flesh of
men.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief is now washed from his
sable covering, anointed with bears fat,
and painted, with their red paint, in such
figures as will make him appear most terrible
to his enemies. He then sings the
war song, and enumerates his warlike actions.
Having done this he fixes his eyes
on the sun, and pays his adorations to
the Great Spirit, in which he is accompanied
by all the warriors.</p>

<p class='c000'>This ceremony is followed with dances,
such as I have before described; and the
whole concludes with a feast which usually
consists of dogs flesh.</p>

<p class='c000'>This feast is held in the hut or tent
of the chief warrior, to which all those
who intend to accompany him in his expedition
send their dishes to be filled; and
during the feast, notwithstanding he has
fasted so long, he sits composedly with
his pipe in his mouth, and recounts the
valorous deeds of his family.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>As the hopes of having their wounds,
should they receive any, properly treated,
and expeditiously cured, must be some additional
inducement to the warriors to expose
themselves more freely to danger, the
priests, who are also their doctors, prepare
such medicines as will prove efficacious.
With great ceremony they collect various
roots and plants, and pretend that they
impart to them the power of healing.</p>

<p class='c000'><a id='not'></a>Notwithstanding this superstitious method
of proceeding, it is very certain that
they have acquired a knowledge of many
plants and herbs that are of a medicinal
quality, and which they know how to use
with great skill.</p>

<p class='c000'>From the time the resolution of engaging
in a war is taken, to the departure of
the warriors, the nights are spent in festivity,
and their days in making the needful
preparations.</p>

<p class='c000'>If it is thought necessary by the nation
going to war, to solicit the alliance
of any neighbouring tribe, they fix upon
one of their chiefs who speaks the language
of that people well, and who is a
good orator, and send to them by him a
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span>belt of wampum, on which is specified
the purport of the embassy in figures that
every nation is well acquainted with. At
the same time he carries with him a
hatchet painted red.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as he reaches the camp or village
to which he is destined, he acquaints
the chief of the tribe with the general
tenor of his commission, who immediately
assembles a council, to which the ambassador
is invited. There having laid the
hatchet on the ground he holds the belt
in his hand, and enters more minutely
into the occasion of his embassy. In his
speech he invites them to take up the
hatchet, and as soon as he has finished
speaking delivers the belt.</p>

<p class='c000'>If his hearers are inclined to become
auxiliaries to his nation, a chief steps
forward and takes up the hatchet, and
they immediately espouse with spirit the
cause they have thus engaged to support.
But if on this application neither the belt
or hatchet are accepted, the emissary concludes
that the people whose assistance he
solicits have already entered into an alliance
with the foes of his nation, and returns
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span>with speed to inform his countrymen
of his ill success.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner in which the Indians declare
war against each other, is by sending
a slave with a hatchet, the handle
of which is painted red, to the nation
which they intend to break with; and
the messenger, notwithstanding the danger
to which he is exposed from the sudden
fury of those whom he thus sets at defiance,
executes his commission with great
fidelity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes this token of defiance has
such an instantaneous effect on those to
whom it is presented, that in the first
transports of their fury a small party will
issue forth, without waiting for the permission
of the elder chiefs, and slaying
the first of the offending nation they meet,
cut open the body and stick a hatchet of
the same kind as that they have just received,
into the heart of their slaughtered
foe. Among the more remote tribes this
is done with an arrow or spear, the end of
which is painted red. And the more to
exasperate, they dismember the body, to
show that they esteem them not as men
but as old women.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span>The Indians seldom take the field in
large bodies, as such numbers would require
a greater degree of industry to provide
for their subsistence, during their tedious
marches through dreary forests, or
long voyages over lakes and rivers, than
they would care to bestow.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their armies are never encumbered
with baggage or military stores. Each
warrior, besides his weapons, carries with
him only a mat, and whilst at a distance
from the frontiers of the enemy supports
himself with the game he kills or the fish
he catches.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they pass through a country
where they have no apprehensions of meeting
with an enemy, they use very little
precaution: sometimes there are scarcely a
dozen warriors left together, the rest being
dispersed in pursuit of their game;
but though they should have roved to a
very considerable distance from the war-path,
they are sure to arrive at the place
of rendezvous by the hour appointed.</p>

<p class='c000'>They always pitch their tents long
before sun-set; and being naturally presumptuous
take very little care to guard
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>against a surprize. They place great
confidence in their Manitous, or houshold
gods, which they always carry with
them; and being persuaded that they
take upon them the office of centinels,
they sleep very securely under their protection.</p>

<p class='c000'>These Manitous, as they are called
by some nations, but which are termed
Wakons, that is, spirits, by the Naudowessies,
are nothing more than the otter
and martins skins I have already described,
for which, however, they have a great
veneration.</p>

<p class='c000'>After they have entered the enemies
country, no people can be more cautious
and circumspect; fires are no longer lighted,
no more shouting is heard, nor the
game any longer pursued. They are not
even permitted to speak; but must convey
whatever they have to impart to each other
by signs and motions.</p>

<p class='c000'>They now proceed wholly by stratagem
and ambuscade. Having discovered
their enemies, they send to reconnoitre
them; and a council is immediately held,
during which they speak only in whispers,
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span>to consider of the intelligence imparted by
those who were sent out.</p>

<p class='c000'>The attack is generally made just before
day-break, at which period they suppose
their foes to be in the soundest sleep.
Throughout the whole of the preceding
night they will lie flat upon their faces,
without stirring; and make their approaches
in the same posture, creeping
upon their hands and feet till they are got
within bow-shot of those they have destined
to destruction. On a signal given
by the chief warrior, to which the whole
body makes answer by the most hideous
yells, they all start up, and discharging
their arrows in the same instant, without
giving their adversaries time to recover
from the confusion into which they are
thrown, pour in upon them with their
war-clubs or tomahawks.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians think there is little glory
to be acquired from attacking their enemies
openly in the field; their greatest
pride is to surprize and destroy. They seldom
engage without a manifest appearance
of advantage. If they find the enemy on
their guard, too strongly entrenched, or
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span>superior in numbers, they retire, provided
<a id='there'></a>there is an opportunity of doing
so. And they esteem it the greatest qualification
of a chief warrior, to be able to
manage an attack, so as to destroy as many
of the enemy as possible, at the expence of
a few men.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes they secure themselves behind
trees, hillocks, or stones, and having
given one or two rounds retire before
they are discovered. Europeans, who are
unacquainted with this method of fighting
too often find to their cost the destructive
efficacy of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Braddock was one of this unhappy
number. Marching in the year
1755, to attack Fort Du Quesne, he was
intercepted by a party of French and confederate
Indians in their interest, who by
this insidious method of engaging found
means to defeat his army, which consisted
of about two thousand brave and well-disciplined
troops. So securely were the
Indians posted, that the English scarcely
knew from whence or by whom they
were thus annoyed. During the whole
of the engagement the latter had scarcely
a sight of an enemy; and were obliged
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span>to retreat without the satisfaction of being
able to take the least degree of revenge
for the havock made among them. The
General paid for his temerity with his
life, and was accompanied in his fall by a
great number of brave fellows; whilst his
invisible enemies had only two or three of
their number wounded.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Indians succeed in their
silent approaches, and are able to force the
camp which they attack, a scene of horror,
that exceeds description, ensues. The
savage fierceness of the conquerors, and
the desperation of the conquered, who well
know what they have to expect should
they fall alive into the hands of their assailants,
occasion the most <a id='extra'></a>extraordinary
exertions on both sides. The figure of
the combatants all besmeared with black
and red paint, and covered with the blood
of the slain, their horrid yells, and ungovernable
fury, are not to be conceived
by those who have never crossed the Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have frequently been a spectator of
them, and once bore a part in a similar
scene. But what added to the horror
of it was, that I had not the consolation
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>of being able to oppose their savage attacks.
Every circumstance of the adventure
still dwells on my remembrance, and
enables me to describe with greater perspicuity
the brutal fierceness of the Indians
when they have surprized or overpowered
an enemy.</p>

<p class='c000'>As a detail of the massacre at Fort
William Henry in the year 1757, the
scene to which I refer, cannot appear foreign
to the design of this publication, but
will serve to give my readers a just idea
of the ferocity of this people, I shall take
the liberty to insert it, apologizing at
the same time for the length of the digression,
and those egotisms which the
relation renders unavoidable.</p>

<p class='c000'>General Webb, who commanded the
English army in North America, which
was then encamped at Fort Edward, having
intelligence that the French troops
under Mons. Montcalm were making
some movements towards Fort William
Henry, he detached a corps of about fifteen
hundred men, consisting of English
and Provincials, to strengthen the garrison.
In this party I went as a volunteer among
the latter.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span>The apprehensions of the English General
were not without foundation; for
the day after our arrival we saw Lake
George (formerly Lake Sacrament) to
which it lies contiguous, covered with an
immense number of boats; and in a few
hours we found our lines attacked by the
French General, who had just landed with
eleven thousand Regulars and Canadians,
and two thousand Indians. Colonel Monro,
a brave officer, commanded in the Fort,
and had no more than two thousand three
hundred men with him, our detachment
included.</p>

<p class='c000'>With these he made a gallant defence,
and probably would have been able at
last to preserve the Fort, had he been
properly supported, and permitted to continue
his efforts. On every summons to surrender
sent by the French General,
who offered the most honourable terms,
his answer repeatedly was, That he yet
found himself in a condition to repel the
most vigorous attacks his besiegers were
able to make; and if he thought his present
force insufficient, he could soon be
supplied with a greater number from the
adjacent army.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span>But the Colonel having acquainted
General Webb with his situation, and
desired he would send him some fresh
troops, the general dispatched a messenger
to him with a letter, <a id='wherein'></a>wherein he informed
him that it was not in his power to assist
him, and therefore gave him orders to surrender
up the Fort on the best terms he
could procure. This packet fell into the
hands of the French General, who immediately
sent a flag of truce, desiring a
conference with the governor.</p>

<p class='c000'>They accordingly met, attended only
by a small guard, in the centre between
the lines; when Mons. Montcalm told
the Colonel, that he was come in person
to demand possession of the Fort, as it belonged
to the King his master. The Colonel
replied, that he knew not how that
could be, nor should he surrender it up
whilst it was in his power to defend it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The French General rejoined, at the
same time delivering the packet into the
Colonel’s hand, “By this authority do
I make the requisition.” The brave
Governor had no sooner read the contents
of it, and was convinced that such were
the orders of the commander in chief, and
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span>not to be disobeyed, than he hung his head
in silence, and reluctantly entered into a
negociation.</p>

<p class='c000'>In consideration of the gallant defence
the garrison had made, they were to be
permitted to march out with all the honours
of war, to be allowed covered waggons
to transport their baggage to Fort
Edward, and a guard to protect them from
the fury of the savages.</p>

<p class='c000'>The morning after the capitulation was
signed, as soon as day broke, the whole
garrison, now consisting of about two
thousand men, besides women and children,
were drawn up within the lines,
and on the point of marching off, when
great numbers of the Indians gathered
about, and began to plunder. We were
at first in hopes that this was their only
view, and suffered them to proceed without
opposition. Indeed it was not in our
power to make any, had we been so
inclined; for though we were permitted
to carry off our arms, yet we were
not allowed a single round of ammunition.
In these hopes however we were
disappointed: for presently some of them
began to attack the sick and wounded,
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>when such as were not able to crawl into
the ranks, notwithstanding they endeavoured
to avert the fury of their enemies
by their shrieks or groans, were soon dispatched.</p>

<p class='c000'>Here we were fully in expectation that
the disturbance would have concluded;
and our little army began to move; but
in a short time we saw the front division
driven back, and discovered that we were
entirely encircled by the savages. We
expected every moment that the guard,
which the French, by the articles of capitulation,
had agreed to allow us, would
have arrived, and put an end to our apprehensions;
but none appeared. The
Indians now began to strip every one
without exception of their arms and
cloaths, and those who made the least resistance
felt the weight of their tomahawks.</p>

<p class='c000'>I happened to be in the rear division,
but it was not long before I shared the
fate of my companions. Three or four
of the savages laid hold of me, and whilst
some held their weapons over my head,
the others soon disrobed me of my coat,
waistcoat, hat, and buckles, omitting not
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>to take from me what money I had in
my pocket. As this was transacted close
by the passage that led from the lines on
to the plain, near which a French centinel
was posted, I ran to him and claimed
his protection; but he only called me
an English dog, and thrust me with violence
back again into the midst of the Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now endeavoured to join a body of
our troops that were crowded together at
some distance; but innumerable were the
blows that were made at me with different
weapons as I passed on; luckily however
the savages were so close together,
that they could not strike at me without
endangering each other. Notwithstanding
which one of them found means
to make a thrust at me with a spear,
which grazed my side, and from another
I received a wound, with the same kind
of weapon, in my <a id='ancle'></a>ancle. At length I
gained the spot where my countrymen
stood, and forced myself into the midst
of them. But before I got thus far out
of the hands of the Indians, the collar
and wristbands of my shirt were all that
remained of it, and my flesh was scratched
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>and torn in many places by their savage
gripes.</p>

<p class='c000'>By this time the war-hoop was given,
and the Indians began to murder those
that were nearest to them without distinction.
It is not in the power of words to
give any tolerable idea of the horrid scene
that now ensued; men, women, and children
were dispatched in the most wanton
and cruel manner, and immediately scalped.
Many of these savages drank the blood of
their victims, as it flowed warm from the
fatal wound.</p>

<p class='c000'>We now perceived, though too late
to avail us, that we were to expect no
relief from the French; and that, contrary
to the agreement they had so lately
signed to allow us a sufficient force to
protect us from these insults, they tacitly
permitted them; for I could plainly
perceive the French officers walking
about at some distance, discoursing together
with apparent unconcern. For the honour
of human nature I would hope that
this flagrant breach of every sacred law,
proceeded rather from the savage disposition
of the Indians, which I acknowledge
it is sometimes almost impossible
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>to controul, and which might now unexpectedly
have arrived to a pitch not easily
to be restrained, than to any premeditated
design in the French commander. An
unprejudiced observer would, however,
be apt to conclude, that a body of ten
thousand christian troops, most christian
troops, had it in their power to prevent
the massacre from becoming so general.
But whatever was the cause from which
it arose, the consequences of it were dreadful,
and not to be paralleled in modern
history.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the circle in which I stood inclosed
by this time was much thinned, and death
seemed to be approaching with hasty
strides, it was proposed by some of the
most resolute to make one vigorous effort,
and endeavour to force our way through
the savages, the only probable method of
preserving our lives that now remained.
This, however desperate, was resolved on,
and about twenty of us sprung at once
into the midst of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>In a moment we were all separated,
and what was the fate of my companions
I could not learn till some months after,
when I found that only six or seven of
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span>them effected their design. Intent only
on my own hazardous situation, I endeavoured
to make my way through my
savage enemies in the best manner possible.
And I have often been astonished
since, when I have recollected with what
composure I took, as I did, every necessary
step for my preservation. Some
I overturned, being at that time young
and athletic, and others I passed by,
dextrously avoiding their weapons; till
at last two very stout chiefs, of the
most savage tribes, as I could distinguish
by their dress, whose strength I could
not resist, laid hold of me by each arm,
and began to force me through the
crowd.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now resigned myself to my fate, not
doubting but that they intended to dispatch
me, and then to satiate their vengeance
with my blood, as I found they
were hurrying me towards a retired
swamp that lay at some distance. But before
we had got many yards, an English
gentleman of some distinction, as I could
discover by his breeches, the only covering
he had on, which were of fine scarlet
velvet, rushed close by us. One of
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span>the Indians instantly relinquished his
hold, and springing on this new object,
endeavoured to seize him as his prey;
but the gentleman being strong, threw
him on the ground, and would probably
have got away, had not he who held my
other arm, quitted me to assist his brother.
I seized the opportunity, and hastened
away to join another party of English
troops that were yet unbroken, and
stood in a body at some distance. But
before I had taken many steps, I hastily
cast my eye towards the gentleman, and
saw the Indian’s tomahawk gash into
his back, and heard him utter his last
groan; this added both to my speed and
desperation.</p>

<p class='c000'>I had left this shocking scene but a few
yards, when a fine boy about twelve years
of age, that had hitherto escaped, came
up to me, and begged that I would let
him lay hold of me, so that he might
stand some chance of getting out of the
hands of the savages. I told him that I
would give him every assistance in my
power, and to this purpose bid him lay
hold; but in a few moments he was torn
from my side, and by his shrieks I judge
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span>was soon demolished. I could not help
forgetting my own cares for a minute, to
lament the fate of so young a sufferer;
but it was utterly impossible for me to
take any methods to prevent it.</p>

<p class='c000'>I now got once more into the midst
of friends, but we were unable to afford
each other any succour. As this was the
division that had advanced the furthest
from the fort, I thought there might be
a possibility (though but a very bare one)
of my forcing my way through the outer
ranks of the Indians, and getting to a
neighbouring wood, which I perceived at
some distance. I was still encouraged to
hope by the almost miraculous preservation
I had already experienced.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nor were my hopes vain, or the efforts
I made ineffectual. Suffice it to
say that I reached the wood; but by the
time I had penetrated a little way into it,
my breath was so exhausted that I threw
myself into a brake, and lay for some
minutes apparently at the last gasp. At
length I recovered the power of respiration;
but my apprehensions returned
with all their former force, when I saw
several savages pass by, probably in pursuit
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span>of me, at no very great distance. In
this situation I knew not whether it was
better to proceed, or endeavour to conceal
myself where I lay, till night came on;
fearing, however, that they would return
the same way, I thought it most prudent
to get farther from the dreadful scene of
my past distresses. Accordingly, striking
into another part of the wood, I hastened
on as fast as the briars and the loss of one
of my shoes would permit me; and after
a slow progress of some hours, gained a
hill that overlooked the plain which I
had just left, from whence I could discern
that the bloody storm still raged with
unabated fury.</p>

<p class='c000'>But not to tire my readers, I shall
only add, that after passing three days
without subsistence, and enduring the severity
of the cold dews for three nights,
I at length reached Fort Edward; where
with proper care my body soon recovered
its wonted strength, and my mind, as
far as the recollection of the late melancholy
events would permit, its usual composure.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was computed that fifteen hundred
persons were killed or made prisoners by
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span>these savages during this fatal day. Many
of the latter were carried off by them and
never returned. A few, through favourable
accidents, found their way back to
their native country, after having experienced
a long and severe captivity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brave Colonel Monro had hastened
away, soon after the confusion began, to
the French camp to endeavour to procure
the guard agreed by the stipulation;
but his application proving ineffectual, he
remained there till General Webb sent a
party of troops to demand and protect him
back to Fort Edward. But these unhappy
occurrences, which would probably
have been prevented, had he been
left to pursue his own plans, together with
the loss of so many brave fellows, murdered
in cold blood, to whose valour he
had been so lately a witness, made such
an impression on his mind, that he did
not long survive. He died in about three
months of a broken heart, and with truth
might it be said, that he was an honour
to his country.</p>

<p class='c000'>I mean not to point out the following
circumstance as the immediate judgment
of heaven, and intended as an atonement
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span>for this slaughter; but I cannot omit that
very few of those different tribes of Indians
that shared in it ever lived to return
home. The small pox, by means of their
communication with the Europeans, found
its way among them, and made an
equal havock to what they themselves had
done. The methods they pursued on the
first attack of that malignant disorder, to
abate the fever attending it, rendered it
fatal. Whilst their blood was in a state
of fermentation, and nature was striving
to throw out the peccant matter, they
checked her operations by plunging into
the water: the consequence was, that
they died by hundreds. The few that
survived were transformed by it into hideous
objects, and bore with them to the
grave deep indented marks of this much-dreaded
disease.</p>

<p class='c000'>Monsieur Montcalm fell soon after on
the plains of Quebec.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the unprovoked cruelty of this
commander was not approved of by the
generality of his countrymen, I have
since been convinced of by many proofs.
One only however, which I received
from a person who was witness to it,
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span>shall I at present give. A Canadian
merchant, of some consideration, having
heard of the surrender of the English
Fort, celebrated the fortunate event with
great rejoicings and hospitality, according
to the custom of that country; but no
sooner did the news of the massacre which
ensued reach his ears, than he put an
immediate stop to the festivity, and exclaimed
in the severest terms against the
inhuman permission; declaring at the same
time that those who had connived at it,
had thereby drawn down on that part
of their king’s dominions the vengeance
of heaven. To this he added, that he
much feared the total loss of them would
deservedly be the consequence. How
truly this prediction has been verified we
all know.</p>

<p class='c000'>But to return—Though the Indians are
negligent in guarding against surprizes,
they are alert and dextrous in surprizing
their enemies. To their caution and perseverance
in stealing on the party they
design to attack, they add that admirable
talent, or rather instinctive qualification,
I have already described, of tracing
out those they are in pursuit of. On
<span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span>the smoothest grass, on the hardest earth,
and even on the very stones, will they
discover the traces of an enemy, and by
the shape of the footsteps, and the distance
between the prints, distinguish not only
whether it is a man or woman who has
passed that way, but even the nation to
which they belong. However incredible
this might appear, yet, from the many
proofs I received whilst among them of
their amazing sagacity in this point, I see
no reason to discredit even these extraordinary
exertions of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they have overcome an enemy,
and victory is no longer doubtful, the
conquerors first dispatch all such as they
think they shall not be able to carry off
without great trouble, and then endeavour
to take as many prisoners as possible; after
this they return to scalp those who are
either dead, or too much wounded to be
taken with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>At this business they are exceedingly
expert. They seize the head of the disabled
or dead enemy, and placing one
of their feet on the neck, twist their
left hand in the hair; by this means,
having extended the skin that covers the
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>top of the head, they draw out their scalping
knives, which are always kept in good
order for this cruel purpose, and with a
few dextrous strokes take off the part that
is termed the scalp. They are so expeditious
in doing this, that the whole time
required scarcely exceeds a minute. These
they preserve as monuments of their prowess,
and at the same time as proofs of
the vengeance they have inflicted on their
enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>If two Indians seize in the same instant
a prisoner, and seem to have an equal
claim, the contest between them is soon
decided; for to put a speedy end to any
dispute that might arise, the person that
is apprehensive he shall lose his expected
reward, immediately has recourse to his
tomahawk or war-club, and knocks on
the head the unhappy cause of their contention.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having completed their purposes, and
made as much havock as possible, they immediately
retire towards their own country,
with the spoil they have acquired,
for fear of being pursued.</p>

<p class='c000'>Should this be the case, they make use
of many stratagems to elude the searches
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span>of their pursuers. They sometimes scatter
leaves, sand, or dust over the prints
of their feet; sometimes tread in each
others footsteps; and sometimes lift their
feet so high, and tread so lightly, as not
to make any impression on the ground.
But if they find all these precautions
unavailing, and that they are near being
overtaken, they first dispatch and scalp
their prisoners, and then dividing, each
endeavours to regain his native country
by a different route. This prevents all
farther pursuit; for their pursuers now
despairing, either of gratifying their
revenge, or of releasing those of their
friends who were made captives, return
home.</p>

<p class='c000'>If the successful party is so lucky as
to make good their retreat unmolested,
they hasten with the greatest expedition
to reach a country where they may be
perfectly secure; and that their wounded
companions may not retard their flight,
they carry them by turns in litters, or if
it is in the winter season draw them on
sledges.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their litters are made in a rude manner
of the branches of trees. Their sledges
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span>consist of two small thin boards about a
foot wide when joined, and near six feet
long. The fore part is turned up, and
the sides are bordered with small bands.
The Indians draw these carriages with
great ease, be they ever so much loaded,
by means of a string which passes round
the breast. This collar is called a Metump,
and is in use throughout America,
both in the settlements and the internal
parts. Those used in the latter are made
of leather, and very curiously wrought.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoners during their march are
guarded with the greatest care. During
the day, if the journey is over land, they
are always held by some of the victorious
party; if by water, they are fastened to
the canoe. In the night-time they are
stretched along the ground quite naked,
with their legs, arms, and neck fastened
to hooks fixed in the ground. Besides
this, cords are tied to their arms or legs,
which are held by an Indian, who instantly
awakes at the least motion of
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding such precautions are
usually taken by the Indians, it is recorded
in the annals of New England,
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span>that one of the weaker sex, almost alone,
and unassisted, found means to elude the
vigilance of a party of warriors, and not
only to make her escape from them, but
to revenge the cause of her countrymen.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some years ago, a small band of Canadian
Indians, consisting of ten warriors
attended by two of their wives, made an
irruption into the back settlements of
New England. They lurked for some
time in the vicinity of one of the most exterior
towns, and at length, after having
killed and scalped several people, found
means to take prisoner a woman who had
with her a son of about twelve years of
age. Being satisfied with the execution
they had done, they retreated towards their
native country, which lay at three hundred
miles distance, and carried off with them
their two captives.</p>

<p class='c000'>The second night of their retreat, the
woman, whose name, if I mistake not, was
Rowe, formed a resolution worthy of the
most intrepid hero. She thought she
should be able to get from her hands the
manacles by which they were confined,
and determined if she did so to make a
desperate effort for the recovery of her
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>freedom. To this purpose, when she concluded
that her conquerors were in their
soundest sleep, she strove to slip the cords
from her hands. In this she succeeded;
and cautioning her son, whom they had
suffered to go unbound, in a whisper,
against being surprized at what she was
about to do, she removed to a distance with
great wariness the defensive weapons of
the Indians, which lay by their sides.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having done this, she put one of the
tomahawks into the hands of the boy,
bidding him to follow her example; and
taking another herself, fell upon the sleeping
Indians, several of whom she instantly
dispatched. But her attempt was nearly
frustrated by the imbecility of her son,
who wanting both strength and resolution,
made a feeble stroke at one of them, which
only served to awaken him; she however
sprung at the rising warrior, and before he
could recover his arms, made him sink
under the weight of her tomahawk; and
this she alternately did to all the rest, except
one of the women, who awoke in
time, and made her escape.</p>

<p class='c000'>The heroine then took off the scalps
of her vanquished enemies, and seizing
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span>also those they were carrying away with
them as proofs of their success, she returned
in triumph to the town from
whence she had so lately been dragged, to
the great astonishment of her neighbours,
who could scarcely credit their senses, or
the testimonies she bore of her Amazonian
intrepidity.</p>

<p class='c000'>During their march they oblige their
prisoners to sing their death-song, which
generally consists of these or similar sentences:
“I am going to die, I am about
to suffer; but I will bear the severest
tortures my enemies can inflict with becoming
fortitude. I will die like a
brave man, and I shall then go to join
the chiefs that have suffered on the same
account.” These songs are continued
with necessary intervals, until they reach the
village or camp to which they are going.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the warriors are arrived within
hearing, they set up different cries, which
communicates to their friends a general
history of the success of the expedition.
The number of the death-cries they give,
declares how many of their own party are
lost; the number of war-hoops, the number
of prisoners they have taken.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>It is difficult to describe these cries, but
the best idea I can convey of them is, that
the former consists of the sound Whoo,
Whoo, Whoop, which is continued in a
long shrill tone, nearly till the breath is
exhausted, and then broken off with a
sudden elevation of the voice. The latter
of a loud cry, of much the same kind,
which is modulated into notes by the
hand being placed before the mouth. Both
of them might be heard to a very considerable
distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst these are uttering, the persons
to whom they are designed to convey the
intelligence, continue motionless and all
attention. When this ceremony is performed,
the whole village issue out to
learn the particulars of the relation they
have just heard in general terms, and according
as the news prove mournful or
the contrary, they answer by so many acclamations
or cries of lamentation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Being by this time arrived at the village
or camp, the women and children arm
themselves with sticks and bludgeons, and
form themselves into two ranks, through
which the prisoners are obliged to pass.
The treatment they undergo before they
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span>reach the extremity of the line, is very
severe. Sometimes they are so beaten
over the head and face, as to have scarcely
any remains of life; and happy would it
be for them if by this usage an end was
put to their wretched beings. But their
tormentors take care that none of the
blows they give prove mortal, as they wish
to reserve the miserable sufferers for more
severe inflictions.</p>

<p class='c000'>After having undergone this introductory
discipline, they are bound hand and
foot, whilst the chiefs hold a council in
which their fate is determined. Those
who are decreed to be put to death by the
usual torments, are delivered to the chief
of the warriors; such as are to be spared,
are given into the hands of the chief of
the nation: so that in a short time all the
prisoners may be assured of their fate, as
the sentence now pronounced is irrevocable.
The former they term being consigned
to the house of death, the latter to
the house of grace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such captives as are pretty far advanced
in life, and have acquired great
honour by their warlike deeds, always
atone for the blood they have spilt by the
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span>tortures of fire. Their success in war is
readily known by the blue marks upon
their breasts and arms, which are as legible
to the Indians as letters are to Europeans.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner in which these hieroglyphicks
are made, is by breaking the skin
with the teeth of fish, or sharpened flints,
dipped in a kind of ink made of the foot
of pitch pine. Like those of the ancient
Picts of Britain these are esteemed ornamental;
and at the same time they serve
as registers of the heroic actions of the
warrior, who thus bears about him indelible
marks of his valour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The prisoners destined to death are
soon led to the place of execution, which
is generally in the centre of the camp
or village; where, being stript, and every
part of their bodies blackened, the skin
of a crow or raven is fixed on their heads.
They are then bound to a stake, with
faggots heaped around them, and obliged
for the last time to sing their death-song.</p>

<p class='c000'>The warriors, for such it is only who
commonly suffer this punishment, now
perform in a more prolix manner this sad
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span>solemnity. They recount with an audible
voice all the brave actions they have
performed, and pride themselves in the
number of enemies they have killed. In
this rehearsal they spare not even their
tormentors, but strive by every provoking
tale they can invent to irritate and
insult them. Sometimes this has the desired
effect, and the sufferers are dispatched
sooner than they otherwise would have
been.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are many other methods which
the Indians make use of to put their prisoners
to death, but these are only occasional;
that of burning is most generally
used.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst I was at the chief town of the
Ottagaumies, an Illinois Indian was
brought in, who had been made prisoner
by one of their war parties. I had then
an opportunity of seeing the customary
cruelties inflicted by these people on their
captives, through the minutest part of
their process. After the previous steps
necessary to his condemnation, he was
carried, early in the morning, to a little
distance from the town, where he was
bound to a tree.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='339' id='Page_339'></span>This being done, all the boys, who
amounted to a great number, as the place
was populous, were permitted to amuse
themselves with shooting their arrows at
the unhappy victim. As they were none
of them more than twelve years old, and
were placed at a considerable distance,
they had not strength to penetrate to the
vital parts, so that the poor wretch stood
pierced with arrows, and suffering the
consequent agonies, for more than two
days.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this time he sung his warlike
exploits. He recapitulated every stratagem
he had made use of to surprize his
enemies: he boasted of the quantity of
scalps he possessed, and enumerated the
prisoners he had taken. He then described
the different barbarous methods
by which he had put the latter to death,
and seemed even then to receive inconceivable
pleasure from the recital of the
horrid tale.</p>

<p class='c000'>But he dwelt more particularly on
the cruelties he had practised on such
of the kindred of his present tormentors
as had fallen into his hands; endeavouring
by these aggravated insults to induce
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span>them to increase his tortures, that he
might be able to give greater proofs of fortitude.
Even in the last struggles of life,
when he was no longer able to vent
in words the indignant provocation his
tongue would have uttered, a smile of
mingled scorn and triumph sat on his
countenance.</p>

<p class='c000'>This method of tormenting their enemies
is considered by the Indians as productive
of more than one beneficial consequence.
It satiates, in a greater degree,
that diabolical lust of revenge, which is
the predominant passion in the breast of
every individual of every tribe, and it
gives the growing warriors an early propensity
to that cruelty and thirst for
blood, which is so necessary a qualification
for such as would be thoroughly skilled in
their savage art of war.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have been informed, that an Indian
who was under the hands of his tormentors,
had the audacity to tell them, that
they were ignorant old women, and did
not know how to put brave prisoners to
death. He acquainted them that he had
heretofore taken some of their warriors,
and instead of the trivial punishments
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>they inflicted on him, he had devised for
them the most excruciating torments:
that having bound them to a stake, he
had stuck their bodies full of sharp splinters
of turpentine wood, to which he
then set fire, and dancing around them enjoyed
the agonizing pangs of the flaming
victims.</p>

<p class='c000'>This bravado, which carried with it a
degree of insult that even the accustomed
ear of an Indian could not listen to unmoved,
threw his tormentors off their guard,
and shortened the duration of his torments;
for one of the chiefs ran to him, and
ripping out his heart, stopped with it the
mouth from which had issued such provoking
language.</p>

<p class='c000'>Innumerable are the ironies that may
be told of the courage and resolution of
the Indians, who happen to be made prisoners
by their adversaries. Many that
I have heard are so astonishing, that they
seem to exceed the utmost limits of credibility;
it is, however, certain that these
savages are possessed with many heroic
qualities, and bear every species of misfortune
with a degree of fortitude which
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>has not been outdone by any of the ancient
heroes of either Greece or Rome.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding these acts of severity
exercised by the Indians towards those of
their own species who fall into their hands,
some tribes of them have been remarked
for their moderation to such female prisoners
belonging to the English colonies
as have happened to be taken by them.
Women of great beauty have frequently
been carried off by them, and during a
march of three or four hundred miles
through their retired forests, have lain by
their sides without receiving any insult,
and their chastity has remained inviolate.
Instances have happened where female
captives, who have been pregnant at the
time of their being taken, have found
the pangs of child-birth come upon them
in the midst of solitary woods, and savages
their only companions; yet from
these, savages as they were, have they
received every assistance their situation
would admit of, and been treated with a
degree of delicacy and humanity they little
expected.</p>

<p class='c000'>This forbearance, it must be acknowledged,
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span>does not proceed altogether from
their dispositions, but is only inherent in
those who have held some communication
with the French missionaries. Without
intending that their natural enemies the
English should enjoy the benefit of their labours,
these fathers have taken great pains
to inculcate on the minds of the Indians
the general principles of humanity, which
has diffused itself through their manners,
and has proved of public utility.</p>

<p class='c000'>Those prisoners that are consigned to the
house of grace, and these are commonly the
young men, women, and children, await
the disposal of the chiefs, who, after the
execution of such as are condemned to die,
hold a council for this purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>A herald is sent round the village or
camp, to give notice that such as have
lost any relation in the late expedition are
desired to attend the distribution which
is about to take place. Those women
who have lost their sons or husbands are
generally satisfied in the first place; after
these, such as have been deprived of
friends of a more remote degree of consanguinity,
or who choose to adopt some of
the youth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span>The division being made, which is
done, as in other cases, without the least
dispute, those who have received any share
lead them to their tents or huts; and having
unbound them, wash and dress their
wounds if they happen to have received
any; they then cloath them, and give
them the most comfortable and refreshing
food their store will afford.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst their new domesticks are feeding,
they endeavour to administer consolation
to them; they tell them that as
they are redeemed from death, they must
now be cheerful and happy; and if they
serve them well, without murmuring or
repining, nothing shall be wanting to
make them such atonement for the loss of
their country and friends as circumstances
will allow of.</p>

<p class='c000'>If any men are spared, they are commonly
given to the widows that have lost
their husbands by the hand of the enemy,
should there be any such, to whom, if
they happen to prove agreeable, they are
soon married. But should the dame be
otherwise engaged, the life of him who
falls to her lot is in great danger; especially
if she fancies that her late husband
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>wants a slave in the country of spirits to
which he is gone.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this is the case, a number of young
men take the devoted captive to some distance,
and dispatch him without any ceremony:
after he has been spared by the
council, they consider him of too little
consequence to be intitled to the torments
allotted to those who have been judged
worthy of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The women are usually distributed to
the men, from whom they do not fail of
meeting with a favourable reception. The
boys and girls are taken into the families
of such as have need of them, and are
considered as slaves; and it is not uncommon
that they are sold in the same capacity
to the European traders who come
among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians have no idea of moderating
the ravages of war, by sparing their
prisoners, and entering into a negotiation
with the band from whom they have
been taken, for an exchange. All that
are captivated by both parties, are either
put to death, adopted, or made slaves
of. And so particular are every nation
in this respect, that if any of their tribe,
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span>even a warrior, should be taken prisoner,
and by chance be received into the house
of grace, either as an adopted person or
a slave, and should afterwards make his
escape, they will by no means receive
him, or acknowledge him as one of their
band.</p>

<p class='c000'>The condition of such as are adopted
differs not in any one instance from the
children of the nation to which they now
belong. They assume all the rights of
those whole places they supply, and frequently
make no difficulty of going in the
war-parties against their own countrymen.
Should, however, any of these by chance
make their escape, and be afterwards retaken,
they are esteemed as unnatural children
and ungrateful persons, who have
deserted and made war upon their parents
and benefactors, and are treated with uncommon
severity.</p>

<p class='c000'>That part of the prisoners which are
considered as slaves, are generally distributed
among the chiefs; who frequently
make presents of some of them to the European
governors of the out-posts, or to
the superintendants or commissaries of Indian
affairs. I have been informed that it
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>was the Jesuits and French missionaries
that first occasioned the introduction of
these unhappy captives into the settlements,
and who by so doing taught the
Indians that they were valuable.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their views indeed were laudable, as
they imagined that by this method they
should not only prevent much barbarity
and bloodshed, but find the opportunities
of spreading their religion among them increased.
To this purpose they encouraged
the <a id='trader'></a>traders to purchase such slaves as they
met with.</p>

<p class='c000'>The good effects of this mode of proceeding
was not however equal to the
expectations of these pious fathers. Instead
of being the means of preventing
cruelty and bloodshed, it only caused the
dissensions between the Indian nations to
be carried on with a greater degree of violence,
and with unremitted ardour. The
prize they fought for being no longer revenge
or fame, but the acquirement of spirituous
liquors, for which their captives
were to be exchanged, and of which almost
every nation is immoderately fond, they
sought for their enemies with unwonted
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span>alacrity, and were constantly on the watch
to surprize and carry them off.</p>

<p class='c000'>It might still be said that fewer of the
captives are tormented and put to death,
since these expectations of receiving so valuable
a consideration for them have been
excited than there usually had been; but
it does not appear that their accustomed
cruelty to the warriors they take, is in the
least abated; their natural desire of vengeance
must be gratified; they now only
become more assiduous in securing a
greater number of young prisoners, whilst
those who are made captive in their defence
are tormented and put to death as
before.</p>

<p class='c000'>The missionaries finding that contrary
to their wishes their zeal had only served
to increase the sale of the noxious juices,
applied to the Governor of Canada in the
year 1693, for a prohibition of this baneful
trade. An order was issued accordingly,
but it could not put a total stop to it;
the French Couriers de Boïs were hardy
enough to carry it on clandestinely, notwithstanding
the penalty annexed to a
breach of the prohibition was a considerable
fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span>Some who were detected in the prosecution
of it withdrew into the Indian
countries, where they intermarried with
the natives and underwent a voluntary
banishment. These, however, being an
abandoned and debauched set, their conduct
contributed very little either towards
reforming the manners of their new relations,
or engaging them to entertain a
favourable opinion of the religion they
professed. Thus did these indefatigable
religious men see their designs in some
measure once more frustrated.</p>

<p class='c000'>However, the emigration was productive
of an effect which turned out to be
beneficial to their nation. By the connection
of these refugees with the Iroquois,
Mississuages, Hurons, Miamies, Powtowottomies,
Puants, Menomonies, Algonkins,
&amp;c. and the constant representations
these various nations received from them
of the power and grandeur of the French,
to the aggrandizement of whose monarch,
notwithstanding their banishment, they
still retained their habitual inclination, the
Indians became insensibly prejudiced in
favour of that people, and I am persuaded
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span>take every opportunity of shewing their attachment
to them.</p>

<p class='c000'>And this, even in despite of the disgraceful
estimation they must be held by
them, since they have been driven out of
Canada; for the Indians consider every
conquered people as in a state of vassalage
to their conquerors. After one nation
has finally subdued another, and a conditional
submission is agreed on, it is customary
for the chiefs of the conquered,
when they sit in council with their subduers,
to wear petticoats, as an acknowledgment
that they are in a state of subjection,
and ought to be ranked among the
women. Their partiality to the French
has however taken too deep root for time
itself to eradicate it.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X.<br /> <br /><i>Of their Manner of making</i> <span class='sc'>Peace</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>THE wars that are carried on between
the Indian nations are in
general hereditary, and continue from age
to age with a few interruptions. If a peace
becomes necessary, the principal care of
both parties is to avoid the appearance of
making the first advances.</p>

<p class='c000'>When they treat with an enemy, relative
to a suspension of hostilities, the
chief who is commissioned to undertake the
negociation, if it is not brought about by
the mediation of some neighbouring band,
abates nothing of his natural haughtiness:
even when the affairs of his country are
in the worst situation, he makes no concessions,
but endeavours to persuade his
adversaries that it is their interest to put
an end to the war.</p>

<p class='c000'>Accidents sometimes contribute to bring
about a peace between nations that
otherwise could not be prevailed on to
listen to terms of accommodation. An
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>instance of this, which I heard of in almost
every nation I passed through, I
shall relate.</p>

<p class='c000'>About eighty years ago, the Iroquois
and Chipéways, two powerful nations,
were at war with the Ottagaumies and
Saukies, who were much inferior to their
adversaries both in numbers and strength.
One winter near a thousand of the former
made an excursion from Lake <a id='ontario'></a>Ontario,
by way of Toronto, towards the territories
of their enemies. They coasted
Lake Huron on its east and northern
borders, till they arrived at the island
of St. Joseph, which is situated in the
Straights of St. Marie. There they crossed
these Straights upon the ice about fifteen
miles below the falls, and continued
their route still westward. As the ground
was covered with snow, to prevent a
discovery of their numbers, they marched
in a single file, treading in each others
footsteps.</p>

<p class='c000'>Four Chipéway Indians, passing that
way, observed this army, and readily
guessed from the direction of their march,
and the precautions they took, both the
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span>country to which they were hastening, and
their designs.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding the nation to which
they belonged was at war with the Ottagaumies,
and in alliance with their invaders,
yet from a principle which cannot
be accounted for, they took an instant
resolution to apprize the former of their
danger. To this purpose they hastened
away with their usual celerity, and, taking
a circuit to avoid discovery, arrived
at the hunting grounds of the Ottagaumies,
before so large a body, moving in
so cautious a manner, could do. There
they found a party of about four hundred
warriors, some of which were Saukies,
whom they informed of the approach of
their enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chiefs immediately collected their
whole force, and held a council on the
steps that were to be taken for their defence.
As they were encumbered with
their families, it was <a id='impossible'></a>impossible that they
could retreat in time; they therefore determined
to chuse the most advantageous
spot, and to give the Iroquois the best reception
in their power.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>Not far from the place where they
then happened to be, stood two small
lakes, between which ran a narrow neck
of land about a mile in length, and only
from twenty to forty yards in breadth.
Concluding that the Iroquois intended
to pass <a id='through'></a>through this defile, the united
bands divided their little party into two
bodies of two hundred each. One of
these took post at the extremity of the
pass that lay nearest to their hunting
grounds, which they immediately fortified
with a breast-work formed of palisades;
whilst the other body took a compass round
one of the lakes, with a design to hem
their enemies in when they had entered
the defile.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their stratagem succeeded; for no
sooner had the whole of the Iroquois entered
the pass, than, being provided with
wood for the purpose, they formed a similar
breast-work on the other extremity, and
thus enclosed their enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Iroquois soon perceived their situation,
and immediately held a council on
the measures that were necessary to be
pursued to extricate themselves. Unluckily
for them a thaw had just taken place,
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>which had so far dissolved the ice as to
render it impassible, and yet there still remained
sufficient to prevent them from
either passing over the lakes on rafts, or
from swimming across. In this dilemma
it was agreed that they should endeavour
to force one of the breast-works; but they
soon found them too well defended to effect
their purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding this disappointment,
with the usual composure and unapprehensiveness
of Indians, they amused themselves
three or four days in fishing. By
this time the ice being quite dissolved, they
made themselves rafts, which they were
enabled to do by some trees that fortunately
grew on the spot, and attempted to
cross one of the lakes.</p>

<p class='c000'>They accordingly set off before day-break;
but the Ottagaumies, who had
been watchful of their motions, perceiving
their design, detached one hundred and
fifty men from each of their parties, to
oppose their landing. These three hundred
marched so expeditiously to the other
side of the lake, that they reached it before
their opponents had gained the shore,
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span>they being retarded by their poles sticking
in the mud.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as the confederates arrived,
they poured in a very heavy fire, both
from their bows and musquetry, on the
Iroquois, which greatly disconcerted them;
till the latter finding their situation desperate,
leaped into the water, and fought
their way through their enemies. This
however they could not do without losing
more than half their men.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the Iroquois had landed, they
made good their retreat, but were obliged
to leave their enemies masters of the field,
and in possession of all the furs they had
taken during their winter’s hunt. Thus
dearly did they pay for an unprovoked excursion
to such distance from the route
they ought to have pursued, and to which
they were only impelled by a sudden desire
of cutting off some of their ancient
enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>But had they known their strength
they might have destroyed every man of
the party that opposed them; which
even at the first onset was only inconsiderable,
and, when diminished by the
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span>action, totally unable to make any stand
against them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The victorious bands rewarded the Chipéways,
who had been the means of their
success, with a share of the spoils. They
pressed them to take any quantity they
chose of the richest of the furs, and sent
them under an escort of fifty men, to
their own country. The disinterested
Chipéways, as the Indians in general are
seldom actuated by mercenary motives, for
a considerable time refused these presents,
but were at length persuaded to accept of
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The brave and well-concerted resistance
here made by the Ottagaumies and Saukies,
aided by the mediation of the Chipéways,
who laying aside on this occasion
the animosity they had so long borne
those people approved of the generous
conduct of their four chiefs, were together
the means of effecting a reconciliation
between these nations; and in process
of time united them all in the bands
of amity.</p>

<p class='c000'>And I believe that all the Indians inhabiting
that extensive country, which
lies between Quebec, the banks of the
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>Mississippi north of the Ouisconsin, and
the settlements belonging to the Hudson’s
Bay Company, are at present in a state
of profound peace. When their restless
dispositions will not suffer them to remain
inactive, these northern Indians seldom
commit hostilities on each other, but
make excursions to the southward, against
the Cherokees, Choctahs, Chickasaws or
Illinois.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes the Indians grow tired of a
war which they have carried on against
some neighbouring nation for many years
without much success, and in this case they
seek for mediators to begin a negotiation.
These being obtained, the treaty is thus
conducted.</p>

<p class='c000'>A number of their own chiefs, joined
by those who have accepted the friendly
office, set out together for the country
of their enemies; such as are chosen for
this purpose, are chiefs of the most extensive
abilities and of the greatest integrity.
They bear before them the Pipe
of Peace, which I need not inform my
readers is of the same nature as a Flag
of Truce among the Europeans, and is
treated with the greatest respect and veneration,
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span>even by the most barbarous nations.
I never heard of an instance wherein
the bearers of this sacred badge of
friendship were ever treated disrespectfully,
or its rights violated. The Indians
believe that the Great Spirit never
suffers an infraction of this kind to go unpunished.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pipe of Peace, which is termed
by the French the Calumet, for what
reason I could never learn, is about four
feet long. The bowl of it is made of
red marble, and the stem of it of a light
wood, curiously painted with, hieroglyphicks
in various colours, and adorned
with the feathers of the most beautiful
birds. I have endeavoured to give as exact
a representation of it as possible in #Plate
N<sup>o</sup> IV:weapons#; but it is not in my power to
convey an idea of the various tints and
pleasing ornaments of this much esteemed
Indian implement.</p>

<p class='c000'>Every nation has a different method of
decorating these pipes, and they can tell at
first sight to what band it belongs. It is
used as an introduction to all treaties, and
great ceremony attends the use of it on
these occasions.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span>The assistant or aid-du-camp of the
great warrior, when the chiefs are assembled
and seated, fills it with tobacco mixed
with the herbs before mentioned, taking
care at the same time that no part of it
touches the ground. When it is filled,
he takes a coal that is thoroughly kindled
from a fire which is generally kept burning
in the midst of the assembly, and
places it on the tobacco.</p>

<p class='c000'>As soon as it is sufficiently lighted, he
throws off the coal. He then turns the
stem of it towards the heavens, after this
towards the earth, and now holding it
horizontally moves himself round till he
has completed a circle: by the first action
he is supposed to present it to the Great
Spirit, whose aid is thereby supplicated;
by the second, to avert any malicious interposition
of the evil spirits; and by the
third to gain the protection of the spirits
inhabiting the air, the earth, and the
waters. Having thus secured the favour
of those invisible agents, in whose power
they suppose it is either to forward or obstruct
the issue of their present deliberations,
he presents it to the hereditary
chief; who having taken two or three
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span>whiffs, blows the smoak from his mouth
first towards heaven, and then around him
upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is afterwards put in the same manner
into the mouths of the ambassadors
or strangers, who observe the same ceremony;
then to the chief of the warriors,
and to all the other chiefs in turn according
to their gradation. During this time
the person who executes this honourable
office holds the pipe slightly in his hand,
as if he feared to press the sacred instrument;
nor does any one presume to touch
it but with his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the chiefs who are intrusted with
the commission for making peace, approach
the town or camp to which they
are going, they begin to sing and dance
the songs and dances appropriated to this
occasion. By this time the adverse party
are apprized of their arrival, and divesting
themselves of their wonted enmity at the
sight of the Pipe of Peace, invite them to
the habitation of the Great Chief, and
furnish them with every conveniency during
the negociation.</p>

<p class='c000'>A council is then held; and when the
speeches and debates are ended, if no obstructions
<span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span>arise to put a stop to the treaty,
the painted hatchet is buried in the
ground as a memorial that all animosities
between the contending nations
have ceased, and a peace taken place.
Among the ruder bands, such as have no
communication with the Europeans, a war-club
painted red is buried instead of the
hatchet.</p>

<p class='c000'>A belt of wampum is also given on this
occasion, which serves as a ratification of
the peace, and records to the latest posterity,
by the hieroglyphicks into which the
beads are formed, every stipulated article
in the treaty.</p>

<p class='c000'>These belts are made of shells found on
the coasts of New England and Virginia,
which are sawed out into beads of an oblong
form, about a quarter of an inch long,
and round like other beads. Being strung
on leather strings, and several of them
sewed neatly together with fine sinewy
threads, they then compose what is termed
a belt of Wampum.</p>

<p class='c000'>The shells are generally of two colours,
some white and others violet; but
the latter are more highly esteemed than
the former. They are held in as much
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>estimation by the Indians, as gold, silver,
or precious stones are by the Europeans.</p>

<p class='c000'>The belts are composed of ten, twelve,
or a greater number of strings, according
to the importance of the affair in
agitation, or the dignity of the person to
whom it is presented. On more trifling
occasions, firings of these beads are presented
by the chiefs to each other, and
frequently worn by them about their necks,
as a valuable ornament.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI.<br /> <br /><i>Of their</i> <span class='sc'>Games</span>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c006'>AS I have before observed, the Indians
are greatly addicted to gaming,
and will even stake, and lose with
composure, all the valuables they are possessed
of. They amuse themselves at several
sorts of games, but the principal and
most esteemed among them is that of the
ball, which is not unlike the European
game of tennis.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span>The balls they use are rather larger
than those made use of at tennis, and are
formed of a piece of deer-skin; which
being moistened to render it supple, is
stuffed hard with the hair of the same
creature, and sewed with its sinews. The
ball-sticks are about three feet long, at
the end of which there is fixed a kind of
racket, resembling the palm of the hand,
and fashioned of thongs cut from a deer-skin.
In these they catch the ball, and
throw it to a great distance, if they are not
prevented by some of the opposite party,
who fly to intercept it.</p>

<p class='c000'>This game is generally played by large
companies, that sometimes consist of more
than three hundred; and it is not uncommon
for different bands to play against
each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>They begin by fixing two poles in the
ground at about six hundred yards apart,
and one of these goals belong to each
party of the combatants. The ball is
thrown up high in the centre of the
ground, and in a direct line between the
goals; towards which each party endeavours
to strike it, and which ever side first
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span>causes it to reach their own goal, reckons
towards the game.</p>

<p class='c000'>They are so exceeding dextrous in this
manly exercise, that the ball is usually
kept flying in different directions by the
force of the rackets, without touching
the ground during the whole contention;
for they are not allowed to catch it with
their hands. They run with amazing
velocity in pursuit of each other, and
when one is on the point of hurling it to
a great distance, an antagonist overtakes
him, and by a sudden stroke dashes down
the ball.</p>

<p class='c000'>They play with so much vehemence
that they frequently wound each other,
and sometimes a bone is broken; but notwithstanding
these accidents there never appears
to be any spite or wanton exertions
of strength to effect them, nor do any disputes
ever happen between the parties.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is another game also in use
among them worthy of remark, and this
is the game of the Bowl or Platter.
This game is played between two persons
only. Each person has six or eight
little bones not unlike a peach-stone either
in size or shape, except that they are
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span>quadrangular; two of the sides of which
are coloured black, and the others white.
These they throw up into the air, from
whence they fall into a bowl or platter
placed underneath, and made to spin
round.</p>

<p class='c000'>According as these bones present the
white or black side upwards they reckon
the game: he that happens to have the
greatest number turn up of a similar colour,
counts five points; and forty is the
game.</p>

<p class='c000'>The winning party keeps his place, and
the loser yields his to another who is appointed
by one of the umpires; for a
whole village is sometimes concerned in
the party, and at times one band plays
against another.</p>

<p class='c000'>During this play the Indians appear
to be greatly agitated, and at every decisive
throw set up a hideous shout. They
make a thousand contortions, addressing
themselves at the same time to the bones,
and loading with imprecations the evil
spirits that assist their successful antagonists.
At this game some will lose
their apparel, all the moveables of their
cabins, and sometimes even their liberty,
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>notwithstanding there are no people in
the universe more jealous of the latter
than the Indians are.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII.<br /> <br /><i>Of their</i> <span class='sc'>Marriage Ceremonies</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>THE Indians allow of polygamy,
and persons of every rank indulge
themselves in this point. The chiefs in
particular have a seraglio, which consists of
an uncertain number, usually from six to
twelve or fourteen. The lower ranks are
permitted to take as many as there is a
probability of their being able, with the
children they may bear, to maintain. It
is not uncommon for an Indian to marry
two sisters; sometimes, if there happen
to be more, the whole number; and notwithstanding
this (as it appears to civilized
nations) unnatural union, they all live in
the greatest harmony.</p>

<p class='c000'>The younger wives are submissive to
the elder; and those who have no children,
do such menial offices for those
who are fertile, as causes their situation
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>to differ but little from a state of servitude.
However they perform every injunction
with the greatest cheerfulness, in hopes
of gaining thereby the affection of their
husband, that they in their turns may
have the happiness of becoming mothers,
and be intitled to the respect attendant on
that state.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is not uncommon for an Indian,
although he takes to himself so many
wives, to live in a state of continence
with many of them for several years.
Such as are not so fortunate as to gain the
favour of their husband by their submissive
and prudent behaviour, and by that
means to share in his embraces, continue
in their virgin state during the whole of
their lives, except they happen to be
presented by him to some stranger chief,
whose abode among them will not admit
of his entering into a more lasting connection.
In this case they submit to the
injunction of their husband without murmuring,
and are not displeased at the temporary
union. But if at any time it is
known that they take this liberty without
first receiving his consent, they are
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span>punished in the same manner as if they
had been guilty of adultery.</p>

<p class='c000'>This custom is more prevalent among
the nations which lie in the interior parts,
than among those that are nearer the settlements,
as the manners of the latter are
rendered more conformable in some points
to those of the Europeans, by the intercourse
they hold with them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indian nations differ but little
from each other in their marriage ceremonies,
and less in the manner of their divorces.
The tribes that inhabit the borders
of Canada, make use of the following
custom.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a young Indian has fixed his inclinations
on one of the other sex, he
endeavours to gain her consent, and if he
succeeds, it is never known that her parents
ever obstruct their union. When
every preliminary is agreed on, and the
day appointed, the friends and acquaintance
of both parties assemble at the house
or tent of the oldest relation of the bridegroom,
where a feast is prepared on the
occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The company who meet to assist at
the festival are sometimes very numerous;
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>they dance, they sing, and enter into every
other diversion usually made use of on any
of their public rejoicings. When these
are finished, all those who attended merely
out of ceremony depart, and the bridegroom
and bride are left alone with three
or four of the nearest and oldest relations
of either side; those of the bridegroom
being men, those of the bride, women.</p>

<p class='c000'>Presently the bride, attended by these
few friends, having withdrawn herself for
the purpose, appears at one of the doors
of the house, and is led to the bridegroom,
who stands ready to receive her.
Having now taken their station on a mat
placed in the centre of the room, they
lay hold of the extremities of a wand
about four feet long, by which they continue
separated, whilst the old men pronounce
some short harangues suitable to
the occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The married couple after this make a
public declaration of the love and regard
they entertain for each other, and still
holding the rod between them, dance and
sing. When they have finished this part
of the ceremony, they break the rod into
as many pieces as there are witnesses present,
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>who each take a piece, and preserve
it with great care.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bride is then re-conducted out of
the door at which she entered, where
her young companions wait to attend her
to her father’s house; there the bridegroom
is obliged to seek her, and the
marriage is consummated. Very often
the wife remains at her father’s house till
she has a child, when she packs up her
apparel, which is all the fortune she is
generally possessed of, and accompanies her
husband to his habitation.</p>

<p class='c000'>When from any dislike a separation
takes place, for they are seldom known
to quarrel, they generally give their
friends a few days notice of their
intentions, and sometimes offer reasons to
justify their conduct. The witnesses who
were present at the marriage, meet on
the day requested at the house of the couple
that are about to separate, and bringing
with them the pieces of rod which
they had received at their nuptials, throw
them into the fire in the presence of all
the parties.</p>

<p class='c000'>This is the whole of the ceremony
required, and the separation is carried on
without any murmurings or ill-will between
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span>the couple or their relations; and
after a few months they are at liberty to
marry again.</p>

<p class='c000'>When a marriage is thus dissolved, the
children which have been produced from
it, are equally divided between them; and
as children are esteemed a treasure by the
Indians, if the number happens to be odd,
the woman is allowed to take the better
half.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though this custom seems to encourage
fickleness and frequent separations,
yet there are many of the Indians who
have but one wife, and enjoy with her a
state of connubial happiness not to be exceeded
in more refined societies. There
are also not a few instances of women preserving
an inviolable attachment to their
husbands, except in the cases before-mentioned,
which are not considered as either
a violation of their chastity or fidelity.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although I have said that the Indian
nations differ very little from each other
in their marriage ceremonies, there are
some exceptions. The Naudowessies have
a singular method of celebrating their
marriages, which seems to bear no resemblance
to those made use of by any other
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span>nation I passed through. When one of
their young men has fixed on a young
woman he approves of, he discovers his
passion to her parents, who give him an
invitation to come and live with them in
their tent.</p>

<p class='c000'>He accordingly accepts the offer, and
by so doing engages to reside in it for a
whole year, in the character of a menial
servant. During this time he hunts, and
brings all the game he kills to the family;
by which means the father has an opportunity
of seeing whether he is able to
provide for the support of his daughter
and the children that might be the consequence
of their union. This however is
only done whilst they are young men,
and for their first wife, and not repeated
like Jacob’s servitudes.</p>

<p class='c000'>When this period is expired, the marriage
is solemnized after the custom of
the country, in the following manner:
Three or four of the oldest male relations
of the bridegroom, and as many of the
bride’s, accompany the young couple from
their respective tents to an open part in
the centre of the camp.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>The chiefs and warriors being here assembled
to receive them, a party of the
latter are drawn up in two ranks on each
side of the bride and bridegroom immediately
on their arrival. The principal
chief then acquaints the whole assembly
with the design of their meeting, and tells
them that the couple before them, mentioning
at the same time their names,
are come to avow publicly their intentions
of living together as man and wife. He
then asks the two young people alternately,
whether they desire that the
union might take place. Having declared
with an audible voice that they do so, the
warriors fix their arrows, and discharge
them over the heads of the married pair;
this done, the chief pronounces them
man and wife.</p>

<p class='c000'>The bridegroom then turns round,
and bending his body, takes his wife on
his back, in which manner he carries her
amidst the acclamations of the spectators
to his tent. This ceremony is succeeded
by the most plentiful feast the new married
man can afford, and songs and
dances, according to the usual custom,
conclude the festival.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>Divorces happen so seldom among the
Naudowessies, that I had not an opportunity
of learning how they are accomplished.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adultery is esteemed by them a heinous
crime, and punished with the greatest
rigour. The husband in these cases bites
off the wife’s nose, and a separation instantly
ensues. I saw an instance wherein
this mode of punishment was inflicted,
whilst I remained among them. The
children, when this happens, are distributed
according to the usual custom observed
by other nations, that is, they are
equally divided.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the Indian as well as European
nations, there are many that devote
themselves to pleasure, and notwithstanding
the accounts given by some modern
writers of the frigidity of an Indian constitution,
become the zealous votaries of
Venus. The young warriors that are
thus disposed, seldom want opportunities
for gratifying their passion; and as the
mode usually followed on these occasions
is rather singular, I shall describe it.</p>

<p class='c000'>When one of these young debauchees
imagines from the behaviour of the person
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span>he has chosen for his mistress, that
he shall not meet with any great obstruction
to his suit from her, he pursues
the following plan.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has been already observed, that the
Indians acknowledge no superiority, nor
have they any ideas of subordination, except
in the necessary regulations of their
war or hunting parties; they consequently
live nearly in a state of equality pursuant
to the first principles of nature. The
lover therefore is not apprehensive of any
check or controul in the accomplishment
of his purposes if he can find a convenient
opportunity for completing them.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Indians are also under no apprehension
of robbers, or secret enemies,
they leave the doors of their tents or huts
unfastened during the night, as well as in
the day. Two or three hours after sun-set,
the slaves or old people cover over the
fire, that is generally burning in the midst
of their apartment, with ashes, and retire
to their repose.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst darkness thus prevails, and all
is quiet, one of these sons of pleasure,
wrapped up closely in his blanket to
prevent his being known, will sometimes
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span>enter the apartment of his intended mistress.
Having first lighted at the smothered fire
a small splinter of wood, which answers
the purpose of a match, he approaches the
place where she reposes, and gently pulling
away the covering from her head,
jogs her till she awakes. If she then
rises up, and blows out the light, he
needs no further confirmation that his
company is not disagreeable; but if, after
he has discovered himself, she hides her
head, and takes no notice of him, he
might rest assured that any further solicitations
will prove vain, and that it is necessary
immediately for him to retire.</p>

<p class='c000'>During his stay he conceals the light
as much as possible in the hollow of his
hands, and as the tents or rooms of the
Indians are usually large and capacious,
he escapes without detection. It is said
that the young women who admit their
lovers on these occasions, take great care,
by an immediate application to herbs,
with the potent efficacy of which they
are well acquainted, to prevent the effects
of these illicit amours from becoming visible;
for should the natural consequences
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span>ensue, they must for ever remain unmarried.</p>

<p class='c000'>The children of the Indians are always
distinguished by the name of the mother;
and if a woman marries several husbands,
and has issue by each of them, they are
all called after her. The reason they
give for this is, that as their offspring are
indebted to the father for their souls, the
invisible part of their essence, and to the
mother for their corporeal and apparent
part, it is more rational that they should
be distinguished by the name of the latter,
from whom they indubitably derive their
being, than by that of the father, to
which a doubt might sometimes arise whether
they are justly intitled.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are some ceremonies made use of
by the Indians at the imposition of the
name, and it is considered by them as a
matter of great importance; but what
these are I could never learn, through the
secresy observed on the occasion. I only
know that it is usually given when
the children have passed the state of infancy.</p>

<p class='c000'>Nothing can exceed the tenderness
shown by them to their offspring; and a
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span>person cannot recommend himself to their
favour by any method more certain, than
by paying some attention to the younger
branches of their families. I can impute,
in some measure, to the presents I made
to the children of the chiefs of the Naudowessies,
the hospitable reception I met
with when among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>There is some difficulty attends an explanation
of the manner in which the
Indians distinguish themselves from each
other. Besides the name of the animal
by which every nation and tribe is denominated,
there are others that are personal,
and which the children receive from
their mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chiefs are also distinguished by a
name that has either some reference to
their abilities, or to the hieroglyphick of
their families; and these are acquired
after they arrive at the age of manhood.
Such as have signalized themselves either
in their war or hunting parties, or are
possessed of some eminent qualification,
receive a name that serves to perpetuate
the fame of these actions, or to make
their abilities conspicuous.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span>Thus the great warrior of the Naudowessies
was named Ottahtongoomlishcah,
that is, the Great Father of Snakes;
ottah being in English father, tongoom
great, and lishcah a snake. Another
chief was called Honahpawjatin, which
means a swift runner over the mountains.
And when they adopted me a chief among
them, they named me Shebaygo, which
signifies a writer, or a person that is curious
in making hieroglyphicks, as they
saw me often writing.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII.<br /> <br /><i>Of their</i> <span class='sc'>Religion</span>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>IT is very difficult to attain a perfect
knowledge of the religious principles
of the Indians. Their ceremonies and
doctrines have been so often ridiculed by
the Europeans, that they endeavour to
conceal them; and if, after the greatest
intimacy, you desire any of them to explain
to you their system of religion, to
prevent your ridicule they intermix with
it many of the tenets they have received
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>from the French missionaries, so that it is
at last rendered an unintelligible jargon,
and not to be depended upon.</p>

<p class='c000'>Such as I could discover among the
Naudowessies, for they also were very reserved
in this point, I shall give my readers,
without paying any attention to the
accounts of others. As the religion of
that people from their situation appears to
be totally unadulterated with the superstitions
of the church of Rome, we shall
be able to gain from their religious customs
a more perfect idea of the original
tenets and ceremonies of the Indians in
general, than from those of any nations
that approach nearer to the settlements.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is certain they acknowledge one
Supreme Being or Giver of Life, who
presides over all things. The Chipéways
call this being Manitou or Kitchi-Manitou;
the Naudowessies, Wakon or
Tongo-Wakon, that is, the Great Spirit;
and they look up to him as the
source of good, from whom no evil can
proceed. They also believe in a bad spirit,
to whom they ascribe great power,
and suppose that through his means all the
evils which befall mankind are inflicted.
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span>To him therefore do they pray in their
distresses, begging that he would either
avert their troubles, or moderate them
when they are no longer avoidable.</p>

<p class='c000'>They say that the Great Spirit, who is
infinitely good, neither wishes or is able
to do any mischief to mankind; but on
the contrary, that he showers down on
them all the blessings they deserve;
whereas the evil spirit is continually employed
in contriving how he may punish
the human race; and to do which he is
not only possessed of the will, but of the
power.</p>

<p class='c000'>They hold also that there are good spirits
of a lesser degree, who have their particular
departments, in which they are constantly
contributing to the happiness of mortals.
These they suppose to preside over all the
extraordinary productions of nature, such
as those lakes, rivers, or mountains that
are of an uncommon magnitude; and
likewise the beasts, birds, fishes, and even
vegetables or stones that exceed the rest of
their species in size or singularity. To
all of these they pay some kind of adoration.
Thus when they arrive on the
borders of Lake Superior, on the banks
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span>of the Mississippi, or any other great body
of water, they present to the Spirit who
resides there some kind of offering, as the
prince of the Winnebagoes did when he
attended me to the Falls of St. Anthony.</p>

<p class='c000'>But at the same time I fancy that the
ideas they annex to the word spirit, are
very different from the conceptions more
enlightened nations entertain of it. They
appear to fashion to themselves corporeal
representations of their gods, and believe
them to be of a human form, though of
a nature more excellent than man.</p>

<p class='c000'>Of the same kind are their sentiments
relative to a futurity. They doubt not
but they shall exist in some future state;
they however fancy that their employments
there will be similar to those they
are engaged in here, without the labour
and difficulty annexed to them in this period
of their existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>They consequently expect to be translated
to a delightful country, where they
shall always have a clear unclouded sky,
and enjoy a perpetual spring; where the
forests will abound with game, and the
lakes with fish, which might be taken
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>without requiring a painful exertion of
skill, or a laborious pursuit; in short,
that they shall live for ever in regions of
plenty, and enjoy every gratification they
delight in here, in a greater degree.</p>

<p class='c000'>To intellectual pleasures they are strangers;
nor are these included in their
scheme of happiness. But they expect
that even these animal pleasures will be
proportioned and distributed according to
their merit; the skilful hunter, the bold
and successful warrior, will be entitled to
a greater share than those who through
indolence or want of skill cannot boast of
any superiority over the common herd.</p>

<p class='c000'>The priests of the Indians are at the
same time their physicians, and their conjurors;
whilst they heal their wounds or
cure their diseases, they interpret their
dreams, give them protective charms, and
satisfy that desire which is so prevalent
among them of searching into futurity.</p>

<p class='c000'>How well they execute the latter part
of their professional engagements, and the
methods they make use of on some of
these occasions, I have already shewn in
the exertions of the priest of the Killistinoes,
who was fortunate enough to succeed
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span>in his extraordinary attempt near Lake
Superior. They frequently are successful
likewise in administering the salubrious
herbs they have acquired a knowledge of;
but that the ceremonies they make use of
during the administration of them contributes
to their success, I shall not take
upon me to assert.</p>

<p class='c000'>When any of the people are ill, the
person who is invested with this triple
character of doctor, priest, and magician,
sits by the patient day and night, rattling
in his ears a goad-shell filled with dry
beans, called a Chichicoué, and making a
disagreeable noise that cannot be well described.</p>

<p class='c000'>This uncouth harmony one would imagine
should disturb the sick person, and
prevent the good effects of the doctor’s
prescription; but on the contrary they
believe that the method made use of contributes
to his recovery, by diverting from
his malignant purposes the evil spirit
who has inflicted the disorder; or at least
that it will take off his attention, so that
he shall not increase the malady. This
they are credulous enough to imagine he is
constantly on the watch to do, and would
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>carry his inveteracy to a fatal length if they
did not thus charm him.</p>

<p class='c000'>I could not discover that they make
use of any other religious ceremonies than
those I have described; indeed, on the
appearance of the new moon they dance
and sing; but it is not evident that they
pay that planet any adoration; they only
seem to rejoice at the return of a luminary
that makes the night cheerful, and
which serves to light them on their way
when they travel during the absence of
the sun.</p>

<p class='c000'>Notwithstanding Mr. Adair has asserted
that the nations among whom he resided,
observe with very little variation all the
rites appointed by the Mosaic Law, I own
I could never discover among those tribes
that lie but a few degrees to the north-west,
the least traces of the Jewish religion,
except it be admitted that one particular
female custom and their division into
tribes, carry with them proofs sufficient to
establish this assertion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Jesuits and French missionaries
have also pretended that the Indians had,
when they first travelled into America,
some notions, though these were dark and
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span>confused, of the christian institution; that
they have been greatly agitated at the sight
of a cross, and given proofs, by the impressions
made on them, that they were not
entirely unacquainted with the sacred mysteries
of Christianity. I need not say that
these are too glaring absurdities to be credited,
and could only receive their existence
from the zeal of those fathers, who endeavoured
at once to give the public a
better opinion of the success of their missions,
and to add support to the cause they
were engaged in.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians appear to be in their religious
principles rude and uninstructed.
The doctrines they hold are few and simple,
and such as have been generally impressed
on the human mind, by some
means or other, in the most ignorant ages.
They however have not deviated, as many
other uncivilized nations, and too many
civilized ones have done, into idolatrous
modes of worship; they venerate indeed
and make offerings to the wonderful parts
of the creation, as I have before observed;
but whether these rites are performed on account
of the impression such extraordinary
appearances make on them, or whether
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span>they consider them as the peculiar charge,
or the usual places of residence of the invisible
spirits they acknowledge, I cannot
positively determine.</p>

<p class='c000'>The human mind in its uncultivated
state is apt to ascribe the extraordinary occurrences
of nature, such as earthquakes,
thunder, or hurricanes, to the interposition
of unseen beings; the troubles and
disasters also that are annexed to a savage
life, the apprehensions attendant on a precarious
subsistence, and those numberless
inconveniencies which man in his improved
state has found means to remedy, are
supposed to proceed from the interposition
of evil spirits; the savage consequently
lives in continual apprehensions of their
unkind attacks, and to avert them has recourse
to charms, to the fantastic ceremonies
of his priest, or the powerful influence
of his Manitous. Fear has of course
a greater share in his devotions than gratitude,
and he pays more attention to deprecating
the wrath of the evil than to securing
the favour of the good beings.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians, however, entertain these
absurdities in common with those of every
part of the globe who have not been illumined
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span>by that religion which only can
disperse the clouds of superstition and ignorance,
and they are as free from error as
a people can be that has not been favoured
with its instructive doctrines.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV.<br /> <br /><i>Of their</i> <span class='sc'>Diseases</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>THE Indians in general are healthy,
and subject but to few diseases,
many of those that afflict civilized nations,
and are the immediate consequences of
luxury or sloth, being not known among
them; however the hardships and fatigues
which they endure in hunting or war,
the inclemency of the seasons to which
they are continually exposed, but above
all the extremes of hunger, and that voraciousness
their long excursions consequently
subject them to, cannot fail of impairing
the constitution, and bringing on
disorders.</p>

<p class='c000'>Pains and weaknesses in the stomach
and breast are sometimes the result of their
long fasting, and consumptions of the excessive
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span>fatigue and violent exercises they expose
themselves to from their infancy, before
they have strength sufficient to support
them. But the disorder to which they
are most subject, is the pleurisy; for the
removal of which, they apply their grand
remedy and preservative against the generality
of their complaints, sweating.</p>

<p class='c000'>The manner in which they construct
their stoves for this purpose is as follows:
They fix several small poles in the ground,
the tops of which they twist together so
as to form a rotunda: this frame they
cover with skins or blankets; and they
lay them on with so much nicety, that
the air is kept from entering through any
crevice; a small space being only left just
sufficient to creep in at, which is immediately
after closed. In the middle of
this confined building they place red hot
stones, on which they pour water till a
steam arises that produces a great degree
of heat.</p>

<p class='c000'>This causes an instantaneous perspiration,
which they increase as they please.
Having continued in it for some time,
they immediately hasten to the nearest
stream, and plunge into the water; and,
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>after bathing therein for about half a minute,
they put on their cloaths, sit down
and smoak with great composure, thoroughly
persuaded that the remedy will
prove efficacious. They often make use
of this sudoriferous method to refresh
themselves, or to prepare their minds for
the management of any business that requires
uncommon deliberation and sagacity.</p>

<p class='c000'>They are likewise afflicted with the
dropsy and paralytic complaints, which,
however, are but very seldom known
among them. As a remedy for these as
well as for fevers they make use of lotions
and decoctions, composed of herbs, which
the physicians know perfectly well how
to compound and apply. But they never
trust to medicines alone; they always have
recourse likewise to some superstitious ceremonies,
without which their patients
would not think the physical preparations
sufficiently powerful.</p>

<p class='c000'>With equal judgment they make use of
simples for the cure of wounds, fractures,
or bruises; and are able to extract by
these, without incision, splinters, iron, or
any sort of matter by which the wound is
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>caused. In cures of this kind they are
extremely dextrous, and complete them
in much less time than might be expected
from their mode of proceeding.</p>

<p class='c000'>With the skin of a snake, which those
reptiles annually shed, they will also extract
splinters. It is amazing to see the
sudden efficacy of this application, notwithstanding
there does not appear to be
the least moisture remaining in it.</p>

<p class='c000'>It has long been a subject of dispute,
on what continent the venereal disease
first received its destructive power. This
dreadful malady is supposed to have originated
in America, but the literary contest
still remains undecided; to give some elucidation
to it I shall remark, that as I
could not discover the least traces among
the Naudowessies with whom I resided
so long, and was also informed that it
was yet unknown among the more western
nations, I think I may venture to
pronounce that it had not its origin in
North America. Those nations that have
any communication with the Europeans
or the southern tribes are greatly afflicted
with it; but they have all of them
acquired a knowledge of such certain and
<span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span>expeditious remedies, that the communication
is not attended with any dangerous
consequences.</p>

<p class='c000'>Soon after I set out on my travels, one
of the traders whom I accompanied, complained
of a violent gonorrhœa, with all
its alarming symptoms: this increased to
such a degree, that by the time we had
reached the town of the Winnebagoes,
he was unable to travel. Having made
his complaint known to one of the chiefs
of that tribe, he told him not to be uneasy,
for he would engage that by following
his advice, he should be able in
a few days to pursue his journey, and in
a little longer time be entirely free from
his disorder.</p>

<p class='c000'>The chief had no sooner said this than
he prepared for him a decoction of the
bark of the roots of the prickly Ash, a
tree scarcely known in England, but
which grows in great plenty throughout
North America; by the use of which,
in a few days he was greatly recovered,
and having received directions how to prepare
it, in a fortnight after his departure
from this place perceived that he was radically
cured.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span>If from excessive exercise, or the extremes
of heat or cold, they are affected
with pains in their limbs or joints, they
scarify the parts affected. Those nations
who have no commerce with Europeans
do this with a sharp flint; and it is surprizing
to see to how fine a point they
have the dexterity to bring them; a lancet
can scarcely exceed in sharpness the instruments
they make of this unmalleable
substance.</p>

<p class='c000'>They never can be convinced a person is
ill, whilst he has an appetite; but when
he rejects all kind of nourishment, they
consider the disease as dangerous, and pay
great attention to it; and during the continuance
of the disorder, the physician refuses
his patient no sort of food that he is
desirous of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Their doctors are not only supposed
to be skilled in the physical treatment of
diseases, but the common people believe
that by the ceremony of the chichicoué
usually made use of, as before described,
they are able to gain intelligence from the
spirits of the cause of the complaints with
which they are afflicted, and are thereby
the better enabled to find remedies for
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span>them. They discover something supernatural
in all their diseases, and the physic
administered must invariably be aided by
these superstitions.</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes a sick person fancies that
his disorder arises from witchcraft; in
this case the physician or juggler is consulted,
who, after the usual preparations,
gives his opinion on the state of the disease,
and frequently finds some means for
his cure. But notwithstanding the Indian
physicians always annex these superstitious
ceremonies to their prescriptions, it is
very certain, as I have already observed,
that they exercise their art by principles
which are founded on the knowledge of
simples, and on experience which they acquire
by an indefatigable attention to their
operations.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following story, which I received
from a person of undoubted credit, proves
that the Indians are not only able to reason
with great acuteness on the causes
and symptoms of many of the disorders
which are attendant on human nature,
but to apply with equal judgment proper
remedies.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span>In Penobscot, a settlement in the province
of Main, in the north-east parts of
New England, the wife of a soldier was
taken in labour, and notwithstanding every
necessary assistance was given her, could
not be delivered. In this situation she
remained for two or three days, the persons
around her expecting that the next
pang would put an end to her existence.</p>

<p class='c000'>An Indian woman, who accidentally
passed by, heard the groans of the unhappy
sufferer, and enquired from whence
they proceeded. Being made acquainted
with the desperate circumstances attending
the case, she told the informant, that if
she might be permitted to see the person,
she did not doubt but that she could be of
great service to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>The surgeon that had attended, and the
midwife who was then present, having
given up every hope of preserving their
patient, the Indian woman was allowed
to make use of any methods she thought
proper. She accordingly took a handkerchief,
and bound it tight over the nose
and mouth of the woman: this immediately
brought on a suffocation; and from
the struggles that consequently ensued she
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>was in a few seconds delivered. The moment
this was atchieved, and time enough
to prevent any fatal effect, the handkerchief
was taken off. The long suffering
patient thus happily relieved from her
pains, soon after perfectly recovered, to
the astonishment of all those who had
been witness to her desperate situation.</p>

<p class='c000'>The reason given by the Indian for this
hazardous method of proceeding was, that
desperate disorders require desperate remedies;
that as she observed the exertions of
nature were not sufficiently forcible to
effect the desired consequence, she thought
it necessary to augment their force, which
could only be done by some mode that was
violent in the extreme.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV.<br /> <br /><i>Of the Manner in which they treat their</i> <span class='sc'>Dead</span>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_7_0_7 c006'>AN Indian meets death when it approaches
him in his hut, with the
same resolution he has often faced him
in the field. His indifference relative to
this important article, which is the source
of so many apprehensions to almost every
other nation, is truly admirable. When
his fate is pronounced by the physician,
and it remains no longer uncertain, he harangues
those about him with the greatest
composure.</p>

<p class='c000'>If he is a chief and has a family, he
makes a kind of funeral oration, which
he concludes by giving to his children
such advice for the regulation of their conduct
as he thinks necessary. He then takes
leave of his friends, and issues out orders
for the preparation of a feast, which is designed
to regale those of his tribe that
come to pronounce his eulogium.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>After the breath is departed, the body
is dressed in the same attire it usually
wore whilst living, his face is painted, and
he is seated in an erect posture on a mat
or skin placed in the middle of the hut,
with his weapons by his side. His relations
being seated round, each harangues
in turn the deceased; and if he has been a
great warrior, recounts his heroic actions
nearly to the following purport, which in
the Indian language is extremely poetical
and pleasing:</p>

<p class='c000'>“You still sit among us, Brother,
your person retains its usual resemblance,
and continues similar to ours,
without any visible deficiency, except
that it has lost the power of action.
But whither is that breath flown,
which a few hours ago sent up smoke
to the Great Spirit? Why are those
lips silent, that lately delivered to us
expressive and pleasing language? why
are those feet motionless, that a short
time ago were fleeter than the deer on
yonder mountains? why useless hang
those arms that could climb the tallest
tree, or draw the toughest bow? Alas!
every part of that frame which we
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>lately beheld with admiration and wonder,
is now become as inanimate as it
was three hundred winters ago. We
will not, however, bemoan thee as if
thou wast for ever lost to us, or that
thy name would be buried in oblivion;
thy soul yet lives in the great
Country of Spirits, with those of thy
nation that are gone before thee; and
though we are left behind to perpetuate
thy fame, we shall one day join
thee. Actuated by the respect we bore
thee whilst living, we now come to
tender to thee the last act of kindness
it is in our power to bestow: that thy
body might not lie neglected on the
plain, and become a prey to the beasts
of the field, or the fowls of the air,
we will take care to lay it with those
of thy predecessors who are gone before
thee; hoping at the same time,
that thy spirit will feed with their spirits,
and be ready to receive ours, when
we also shall arrive at the great Country
of Souls.”</p>

<p class='c000'>In short speeches somewhat similar to
this does every chief speak the praises
of his departed friend. When they have
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>so done, if they happen to be at a great
distance from the place of interment appropriated
to their tribe, and the person
dies during the winter season, they wrap
the body in skins, and lay it on a high
stage built for this purpose, or on the
branches of a large tree, till the spring arrives.
They then, after the manner described
in my Journal, carry it, together
with all those belonging to the same nation,
to the general burial-place, where
it is interred with some other ceremonies
that I could not discover.</p>

<p class='c000'>When the Naudowessies brought their
dead for interment to the great cave, I
attempted to get an insight into the remaining
burial rites; but whether it was
on account of the stench which arose from
so many bodies, the weather being then
hot, or whether they chose to keep this
part of their customs secret from me, I
could not discover; I found, however, that
they considered my curiosity as ill-timed,
and therefore I withdrew.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the interment, the band to which
the person belongs, take care to fix near the
place such hieroglyphicks as shall show
to future ages his merit and accomplishments.
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span>If any of these people die in the
summer at a distance from the burying-ground,
and they find it impossible to remove
the body before it putrefies, they
burn the flesh from the bones, and preserving
the latter, bury them in the manner
described.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Indians believe that the souls
of the deceased employ themselves in the
same manner in the country of spirits, as
they did on earth, that they acquire their
food by hunting, and have there, also,
enemies to contend with, they take care
that they do not enter those regions defenceless
and unprovided: they consequently
bury with them their bows, their arrows,
and all the other weapons used either
in hunting or war. As they doubt
not but they will likewise have occasion
both for the necessaries of life, and those
things they esteem as ornaments, they
usually deposit in their tombs such skins
or stuffs as they commonly made their
garments of, domestic utensils, and paint
for ornamenting their persons.</p>

<p class='c000'>The near relations of the deceased lament
his loss with an appearance of great
sorrow and anguish; they weep and howl,
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span>and make use of many contortions, as they
sit in the hut or tent around the body,
when the intervals between the praises of
the chiefs will permit.</p>

<p class='c000'>One formality in mourning for the
dead among the Naudowessies is very different
from any mode I observed in the
other nations through which I passed. The
men, to show how great their sorrow is,
pierce the flesh of their arms, above the
elbows, with arrows; the scars of which
I could perceive on those of every rank,
in a greater or less degree; and the women
cut and gash their legs with sharp
broken flints, till the blood flows very
plentifully.</p>

<p class='c000'>Whilst I remained among them, a
couple whose tent was adjacent to mine,
lost a son of about four years of age. The
parents were so much affected at the death
of their favourite child, that they pursued
the usual testimonies of grief with
such uncommon rigour, as through the
weight of sorrow and loss of blood, to occasion
the death of the father. The woman,
who had hitherto been inconsolable,
no sooner saw her husband expire, than
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span>she dried up her tears, and appeared cheerful
and resigned.</p>

<p class='c000'>As I knew not how to account for so
extraordinary a transition, I took an opportunity
to ask her the reason of it; telling
her at the same time, that I should
have imagined the loss of her husband
would rather have occasioned an increase
of grief, than such a sudden diminution
of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>She informed me, that as the child
was so young when it died, and unable
to support itself in the country of spirits,
both she and her husband had been apprehensive
that its situation would be far
from happy; but no sooner did she behold
its father depart for the same place,
who not only loved the child with the
tenderest affection, but was a good hunter,
and would be able to provide plentifully
for its support, than she ceased to mourn.
She added, that she now saw no reason
to continue her tears, as the child on
whom she doated was happy under the
care and protection of a fond father, and
she had only one wish that remained ungratified,
which was that of being herself
with them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span>Expressions so replete with unaffected
tenderness, and sentiments that would have
done honour to a Roman matron, made
an impression on my mind greatly in favour
of the people to whom she belonged,
and tended not a little to counteract
the prejudices I had hitherto entertained,
in common with every other traveller,
of Indian insensibility and want of parental
tenderness.</p>

<p class='c000'>Her subsequent conduct confirmed the
favourable opinion I had just imbibed;
and convinced me, that, notwithstanding
this apparent suspension of her grief, some
particles of that reluctance to be separated
from a beloved relation, which is implanted
either by nature or custom in
every human heart, still lurked in hers.
I observed that she went almost every evening
to the foot of the tree, on a branch of
which the bodies of her husband and child
were laid, and after cutting off a lock of
her hair, and throwing it on the ground,
in a plaintive melancholy song bemoaned
its fate. A recapitulation of the actions
he might have performed, had his life
been spared, appeared to be her favourite
theme; and whilst she foretold the fame
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span>that would have attended an imitation of
his father’s virtues, her grief seemed to be
suspended:—</p>

<p class='c000'>“If thou hadst continued with us, my
dear Son,” would she cry, “how well
would the bow have become thy hand,
and how fatal would thy arrows have
proved to the enemies of our bands.
Thou wouldst often have drank their
blood, and eaten their flesh, and numerous
slaves would have rewarded thy
toils. With a nervous arm wouldst
thou have seized the wounded buffalo,
or have combated the fury of the enraged
bear. Thou wouldst have overtaken
the flying elk, and have kept
pace on the mountain’s brow with the
fleetest deer. What feats mightest thou
not have performed, hadst thou staid
among us till age had given thee
<a id='strength'></a>strength, and thy father had instructed
thee in every Indian accomplishment!”
In terms like these did this untutored savage
bewail the loss of her son, and frequently
would she pass the greatest part
of the night in the affectionate employ.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Indians in general are very strict
in the observance of their laws relative to
<span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span>mourning for their dead. In some nations
they cut off their hair, blacken <a id='their'></a>their
faces, and sit in an erect posture, with
their heads closely covered, and depriving
themselves of every pleasure. This severity
is continued for several months, and
with some relaxations the appearance is
sometimes kept up for several years. I
was told that when the Naudowessies recollected
any incidents of the lives of their
deceased relations, even after an interval
of ten years, they would howl so as to
be heard at a great distance. They would
sometimes continue this proof of respect
and affection for several hours; and if it
happened that the thought occurred, and
the noise was begun towards the evening,
those of their tribe who were at hand
would join with them.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI.<br /> <br /><i>A concise</i> <span class='sc'>Character</span> <i>of the</i> <span class='sc'>Indians</span>.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>THE character of the Indians, like
that of other uncivilized nations,
is composed of a mixture of ferocity and
gentleness. They are at once guided
by passions and appetites, which they
hold in common with the fiercest beasts
that inhabit their woods, and are possessed
of virtues which do honour to human nature.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the following estimate I shall endeavour
to forget on the one hand the prejudices
of Europeans, who usually annex
to the word Indian epithets that are disgraceful
to human nature, and who view
them in no other light than as savages
and cannibals; whilst with equal care I
avoid any partiality towards them, as
some must naturally arise from the favourable
reception I met with during my stay
among them.</p>

<p class='c000'>At the same time I shall confine my
remarks to the nations inhabiting only
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>the western regions, such as the Naudowessies,
the Ottagaumies, the Chipéways,
the Winnebagoes, and the Saukies;
for as throughout that diversity of
climates, the extensive continent of America
is composed of, there are people of
different dispositions and various characters,
it would be incompatible with my
present undertaking to treat of all these,
and to give a general view of them as a
conjunctive body.</p>

<p class='c000'>That the Indians are of a cruel, revengeful,
inexorable disposition, that they
will watch whole days unmindful of the
calls of nature, and make their way
through pathless, and almost unbounded
woods, subsisting only on the scanty
produce of them, to pursue and revenge
themselves of an enemy; that they hear
unmoved the piercing cries of such as
unhappily fall into their hands, and receive
a diabolical pleasure from the tortures
they inflict on their prisoners, I
readily grant; but let us look on the reverse
of this terrifying picture, and we
shall find them temperate both in their
diet and potations (it must be remembered,
that I speak of those tribes who have
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>little communication with Europeans)
that they with-stand, with unexampled
patience, the attacks of hunger, or the
inclemency of the seasons, and esteem the
gratification of their appetites but as a
secondary consideration.</p>

<p class='c000'>We shall likewise see them sociable
and humane to those whom they consider
as their friends, and even to their adopted
enemies; and ready to partake with them
of the last morsel, or to risk their lives in
their defence.</p>

<p class='c000'>In contradiction to the report of many
other travellers, all of which have been
tinctured with prejudice, I can assert, that
notwithstanding the apparent indifference
with which an Indian meets his wife and
children after a long absence, an indifference
proceeding rather from custom than insensibility,
he is not unmindful of the
claims either of connubial or parental tenderness;
the little story I have introduced
in the preceding chapter of the Naudowessie
woman lamenting her child, and
the immature death of the father, will
elucidate this point, and enforce the assertion
much better than the most studied
arguments I can make use of.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span>Accustomed from their youth to innumerable
hardships, they soon become superior
to a sense of danger or the dread
of death; and their fortitude, implanted
by nature, and nurtured by example,
by precept, and accident, never experiences
a moment’s allay.</p>

<p class='c000'>Though slothful and inactive whilst
their store of provision remains unexhausted,
and their foes are at a distance,
they are indefatigable and persevering in
pursuit of their game, or in circumventing
their enemies.</p>

<p class='c000'>If they are artful and designing, and
ready to take every advantage, if they are
cool and deliberate in their councils, and
cautious in the extreme either of discovering
their sentiments, or of revealing a secret,
they might at the same time boast of possessing
qualifications of a more animated
nature, of the sagacity of a hound, the
penetrating sight of a lynx, the cunning
of the fox, the agility of a bounding roe,
and the unconquerable fierceness of the
tyger.</p>

<p class='c000'>In their public characters, as forming
part of a community, they possess
an attachment for that band to which they
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>belong, unknown to the inhabitants of
any other country. They combine, as if
they were actuated only by one soul,
against the enemies of their nation, and
banish from their minds every consideration
opposed to this.</p>

<p class='c000'>They consult without unnecessary opposition,
or without giving way to the
excitements of envy or ambition, on the
measures necessary to be pursued for the
destruction of those who have drawn
on themselves their displeasure. No selfish
views ever influence their advice,
or obstruct their consultations. Nor is
it in the power of bribes or threats to
diminish the love they bear their country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The honour of their tribe, and the
welfare of their nation, is the first and
most predominant emotion of their hearts;
and from hence proceed in a great measure
all their virtues and their vices.
Actuated by this, they brave every danger,
endure the most exquisite torments,
and expire triumphing in their fortitude,
not as a personal qualification, but as a
national characteristic.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>From thence also flow that insatiable
revenge towards those with whom they
are at war, and all the consequent horrors
that disgrace their name. Their uncultivated
mind, being incapable of judging
of the propriety of an action, in opposition
to their passions, which are totally
insensible to the controuls of reason or humanity,
they know not how to keep
their fury within any bounds, and consequently
that courage and resolution,
which would otherwise do them honour,
degenerates into a savage ferocity.</p>

<p class='c000'>But this short dissertation must suffice;
the limits of my work will not permit
me to treat the subject more copiously,
or to pursue it with a logical regularity.
The observations already made by my readers
on the preceding pages, will, I trust,
render it unnecessary; as by them they
will be enabled to form a tolerably just
idea of the people I have been describing.
Experience teaches, that anecdotes, and
relations of particular events, however
trifling they might appear, enable us to
form a truer judgment of the manners
and customs of a people, and are much
more declaratory of their real state, than
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span>the most studied and elaborate disquisition,
without these aids.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAP. XVII.<br /> <br /><i>Of their</i> <span class='sc'>Language</span>, <span class='sc'>Hieroglyphicks</span>, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>THE principal languages of the natives
of North America may be
divided into four classes, as they consist of
such as are made use of by the nations
of the Iroquois towards the eastern parts
of it, the Chipéways or Algonkins to the
north-west, the Naudowessies to the west,
and the Cherokees, Chickasaws, &amp;c. to
the south. One or other of these four
are used by all the Indians who inhabit
the parts that lie between the coast of
Labradore north, the Florida south, the
Atlantic ocean east, and, as far as we can
judge from the discoveries hitherto made,
the Pacific Ocean on the west.</p>

<p class='c000'>But of all these, the Chipéway tongue
appears to be the most prevailing; it being
held in such esteem, that the chiefs
of every tribe, dwelling about the great
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>lakes, or to the westward of these on the
banks of the Mississippi, with those as far
south as the Ohio, and as far north as Hudson’s
Bay, consisting of more than thirty
different tribes, speak this language alone
in their councils, notwithstanding each has
a peculiar one of their own.</p>

<p class='c000'>It will probably in time become universal
among all the Indian nations, as
none of them attempt to make excursions
to any great distance, or are considered as
qualified to carry on any negociation with
a distant band, unless they have acquired
the Chipéway tongue.</p>

<p class='c000'>At present, besides the Chipéways, to
whom it is natural, the Ottawaws, the
Saukies, the Ottagaumies, the Killistinoes,
the Nipegons, the bands about
Lake Le Pleuve, and the remains of the
Algonkins or Gens de Terre, all converse
in it, with some little variation of
dialect; but whether it be natural to these
nations, or acquired, I was not able to
discover. I am however of opinion that
the barbarous and uncouth dialect of
the Winnebagoes, the Menomonies, and
many other tribes, will become in time
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>totally extinct, and this be adopted in its
stead.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Chipéway tongue is not incumbered
with any unnecessary tones or accents,
neither are there any words in it
that are superfluous; it is also easy to
pronounce, and much more copious than
any other Indian language.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Indians are unacquainted with
the polite arts, or with the sciences, and
as they are also strangers to ceremony or
compliment, they neither have nor need
an infinity of words wherewith to embellish
their discourse. Plain and unpolished
in their manners, they only make
use of such as serve to denominate the necessaries
or conveniences of life, and to
express their wants, which in a state of
nature can be but few.</p>

<p class='c000'>I have annexed hereto a short vocabulary
of the Chipéway language, and another of
that of the Naudowessies, but am not able
to reduce them to the rules of grammar.</p>

<p class='c000'>The latter is spoken in a soft accent,
without any guttural sounds, so that it
may be learnt with facility, and is not
difficult either to be pronounced or written.
It is nearly as copious and expressive
as the Chipéway tongue, and is the
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span>most prevailing language of any on the
Western banks of the Mississippi; being
in use, according to their account, among
all the nations that lie to the north of the
Messorie, and extend as far west as the
shores of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Indians are not acquainted with
letters, it is very difficult to convey with
precision the exact sound of their words;
I have however endeavoured to write them
as near to the manner in which they are
expressed, as such an uncertain mode will
admit of.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the Indians cannot communicate
their ideas by writing, yet they
form certain hieroglyphicks, which, in
some measure, serve to perpetuate any
extraordinary transaction, or uncommon
event. Thus when they are on their excursions,
and either intend to proceed,
or have been, on any remarkable enterprize,
they peel the bark from the trees
which lie in their way, to give intelligence
to those parties that happen to be
at a distance, of the path they must pursue
to overtake them.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following instance will convey a
more perfect idea of the methods they
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span>make use of on this occasion, than any
expressions I can frame.</p>

<p class='c000'>When I left the Mississippi, and proceeded
up the Chipéway River in my
way to Lake Superior, as related in my
Journal, my guide, who was a chief of
the Chipéways that dwell on the Ottawaw
Lake, near the heads of the river
we had just entered, fearing that some
parties of the Naudowessies, with whom
his nation are perpetually at war, might
accidentally fall in with us, and before
they were apprized of my being in company,
do us some mischief, he took the
following steps.</p>

<p class='c000'>He peeled the bark from a large tree
near the entrance of a river, and with
wood-coal mixed with bear’s-grease, their
usual substitute for ink, made in an uncouth
but expressive manner the figure of
the town of the Ottagaumies. He then
formed to the left a man dressed in skins,
by which he intended to represent a Naudowessie,
with a line drawn from his
mouth to that of a deer, the symbol of
the Chipéways. After this he depictured
still farther to the left a canoe as proceeding
up the river, in which he placed
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>a man sitting with a hat on; this figure
was designed to represent an Englishman,
or myself, and my Frenchman was drawn
with a handkerchief tied round his head,
and rowing the canoe; to these he added
several other significant emblems, among
which the Pipe of Peace appeared painted
on the prow of the canoe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The meaning he intended to convey
to the Naudowessies, and which I doubt
not appeared perfectly intelligible to them,
was, that one of the Chipéway chiefs had
received a speech from some Naudowessie
chiefs at the town of the Ottagaumies,
desiring him to conduct the Englishman,
who had lately been among them, up the
Chipéway river; and that they thereby
required, that the Chipéway, notwithstanding
he was an avowed enemy, should
not be molested by them on his passage,
as he had the care of a person whom they
esteemed as one of their nation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some authors have pretended that the
Indians have armorial bearings, which
they blazon with great exactness, and
which distinguish one nation from another;
but I never could observe any other
arms among them than the symbols already
described.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>OF these I shall, in the first place,
give a catalogue, and afterwards a
description of such only as are either peculiar
to this country, or which differ
in some material point from those that
are to be met with in other realms.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>OF THE BEASTS.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Tyger, the Bear, Wolves, Foxes,
Dogs, the Cat of the Mountain, the
Wild Cat, the Buffalo, the Deer, the
Elk, the Moose, the Carrabou, the
Carcajou, the Skunk, the Porcupine,
the Hedge-hog, the Wood-chuck, the
Raccoon, the Martin, the Fisher, the
Muskquaw, Squirrels, Hares, Rabbits,
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span>the Mole, the Weezel, the Mouse, the
Dormouse, the Beaver, the Otter, the
Mink, and Bats.</p>

<p class='c009'>The TYGER. The Tyger of America
resembles in shape those of Africa
and Asia, but is considerably smaller.
Nor does it appear to be so fierce and
ravenous as they are. The colour of it
is a darkish fallow, and it is entirely free
from spots. I saw one on an island in
the Chipéway River, of which I had
a very good view, as it was at no great
distance from me. It sat up on its
hinder parts like a dog; and did not
seem either to be apprehensive of our approach,
or to discover any ravenous inclinations.
It is however very seldom
to be met with in this part of the
world.</p>

<p class='c000'>The BEAR. Bears are very numerous
on this continent, but more particularly
so in the northern parts of it,
and contribute to furnish both food and
beds for almost every Indian nation.
Those of America differ in many respects
from those either of Greenland or Russia,
they being not only somewhat smaller, but
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span>timorous and inoffensive, unless they are
pinched by hunger, or smarting from a
wound. The sight of a man terrifies
them; and a dog will put several to
flight. They are extremely fond of
grapes, and will climb to the top of the
highest trees in quest of them. This
kind of food renders their flesh excessively
rich and finely flavoured; and it is consequently
preferred by the Indians and
traders to that of any other animal. The
fat is very white, and besides being sweet
and wholesome, is possessed of one valuable
quality, which is, that it never
cloys. The inhabitants of these parts
constantly anoint themselves with it, and
to its efficacy they in a great measure
owe their agility. The season for hunting
the bear is during the winter; when
they take up their abode in hollow trees,
or make themselves dens in the roots of
those that are blown down, the entrance
of which they stop up with branches of
fir that lie scattered about. From these
retreats it is said they stir not whilst the
weather continues severe, and as it is well
known that they do not provide themselves
with food, they are supposed to be
<span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span>enabled by nature to subsist for some
months without, and during this time
to continue of the same bulk.</p>

<p class='c000'>The WOLF. The wolves of North
America are much less than those which
are met with in other parts of the world.
They have, however, in common with
the rest of their species, a wildness in their
looks, and a fierceness in their eyes; notwithstanding
which they are far from being
so ravenous as the European wolves,
nor will they ever attack a man, except
they have accidentally fed on the flesh of
those slain in battle. When they herd
together, as they often do in the winter,
they make a hideous and terrible noise.
In these parts there are two kinds; one
of which is of a fallow colour, the other
of a dun, inclining to a black.</p>

<p class='c000'>The FOX. There are two sorts of
foxes in North America, which differ
only in their colour, one being of
a reddish brown, the other of a grey;
those of the latter kind that are found
near the river Mississippi, are extremely
beautiful, their hair being of a fine silver
grey.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='445' id='Page_445'></span>DOGS. The dogs employed by the
Indians in hunting appear to be all of
the same species; they carry their ears
erect, and greatly resemble a wolf about
the head. They are exceedingly useful
to them in their hunting excursions, and
will attack the fiercest of the game they
are in pursuit of. They are also remarkable
for their fidelity to their masters; but
being ill fed by them are very troublesome
in their huts or tents.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CAT of the Mountain. This
creature is in shape like a cat, only much
larger. The hair or fur resembles also the
skin of that domestic animal; the colour
however differs, for the former is of a
reddish or orange cast, but grows lighter
near the belly. The whole skin is beautified
with black spots of different figures,
of which those on the back are long, and
those on the lower parts round. On the
ears there are black stripes. This creature
is nearly as fierce as a leopard, but will
seldom attack a man.</p>

<p class='c000'>The BUFFALO. This beast, of
which there are amazing numbers in these
parts, is larger than an ox, has short
black horns, with a large beard under his
<span class='pageno' title='446' id='Page_446'></span>chin, and his head is so full of hair, that
it falls over his eyes, and gives him a
frightful look. There is a bunch on his
back which begins at the haunches, and
increasing gradually to the shoulders,
reaches on to the neck. Both this excrescence
and its whole body are covered
with long hair, or rather wool, of a dun
or mouse colour, which is exceedingly valuable,
especially that on the fore part of
the body. Its head is larger than a bull’s,
with a very short neck; the breast is
broad, and the body decreases towards the
buttocks. These creatures will run away
at the sight of a man, and a whole herd
will make off when they perceive a single
dog. The flesh of the buffalo is excellent
food, its hide extremely useful, and the
hair very proper for the manufacture of
various articles.</p>

<p class='c000'>The DEER. There is but one species
of deer in North America, and these
are higher and of a slimmer make than
those in Europe. Their shape is nearly
the same as the European, their colour
of a deep fallow, and their horns
very large and branching. This beast is
the swiftest on the American plains, and
<span class='pageno' title='447' id='Page_447'></span>they herd together as they do in other
countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ELK greatly exceeds the deer in
size, being in bulk equal to a horse. Its
body is shaped like that of a deer, only
its tail is remarkably short, being not
more than three inches long. The colour
of its hair, which is grey, and not
unlike that of a camel, but of a more
reddish cast, is nearly three inches in
length, and as coarse as that of a horse.
The horns of this creature grow to a prodigious
size, extending so wide that two
or three persons might sit between them
at the same time. They are not forked
like those of a deer, but have all their
teeth or branches on the outer edge.
Nor does the form of those of the elk
resemble a deer’s, the former being flat,
and eight or ten inches broad, whereas
the latter are round and considerably narrower.
They shed their horns every year
in the month of February, and by August
the new ones are nearly arrived at their
full growth. Notwithstanding their size,
and the means of defence nature has furnished
them with, they are as timorous
as a deer. Their skin is very useful, and
<span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span>will dress as well as that of a buck. They
feed on grass in the summer, and on moss
or buds in the winter.</p>

<p class='c000'>The MOOSE is nearly about the size
of the elk, and the horns of it are almost
as enormous as that animal’s; the stem of
them however are not quite so wide, and
they branch on both sides like those of a
deer. This creature also sheds them every
year. Though its hinder parts are very
broad, its tail is not above an inch long.
It has feet and legs like a camel; its head
is about two feet long, its upper lip
much larger than the under, and the nostrils
of it are so wide that a man might
thrust his hand into them a considerable
way. The hair of the moose is light
grey, mixed with a blackish red. It is
very elastic, for though it be beaten ever
so long, it will retain its original shape.
The flesh is exceeding good food, easy
of digestion, and very nourishing. The
nose, or upper lip, which is large and
loose from the gums, is esteemed a great
delicacy, being of a firm consistence, between
marrow and gristle, and when properly
dressed, affords a rich and luscious
dish. Its hide is very proper for leather,
<span class='pageno' title='449' id='Page_449'></span>being thick and strong, yet soft and pliable.
The pace of this creature is always
a trot, which is so expeditious, that it is
exceeded in swiftness but by few of its
fellow inhabitants of these woods. It is
generally found in the forests, where it
feeds on moss and buds. Though this
creature is of the deer kind, it never
herds as those do. Most authors confound
it with the elk, deer, or carrabou, but it
is a species totally different, as might be
discovered by attending to the description
I have given of each.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CARRABOU. This beast is not
near so tall as the moose, however it is
something like it in shape, only rather
more heavy, and inclining to the form of
the ass. The horns of it are not flat as
those of the elk are, but round like those
of the deer; they also meet nearer together
at the extremities, and bend more over
the face, than either those of the elk or
moose. It partakes of the swiftness of
the deer, and is with difficulty overtaken
by its pursuers. The flesh of it
likewise is equally as good, the tongue
particularly is in high esteem. The skin
<span class='pageno' title='450' id='Page_450'></span>being smooth and free from veins, is as
valuable as shamoy.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CARCAJOU. This creature,
which is of the cat kind, is a terrible
enemy to the preceding four species
of beasts. He either comes upon
them from some concealment unperceived,
or climbs up into a tree, and taking his
station on some of the branches, waits till
one of them, driven by an extreme of
heat or cold, takes shelter under it; when
he fastens upon his neck, and opening the
jugular vein, soon brings his prey to the
ground. This he is enabled to do by his
long tail, with which he encircles the
body of his adversary; and the only
means they have to shun their fate, is
by flying immediately to the water, by
this method, as the carcajou has a great
dislike to that element, he is sometimes
got rid of before he can effect his purpose.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SKUNK. This is the most extraordinary
animal that the American
woods produce. It is rather less than a
pole-cat, and of the same species; it is
therefore often mistaken for that creature,
but is very different from it in many points.
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span>Its hair is long and shining, variegated
with large black and white spots, the
former mostly on the shoulders and rump;
its tail is very bushy, like that of the
fox, part black, and part white, like its
body; it lives chiefly in the woods and
hedges. But its extraordinary powers are
only shewn when it is pursued. As soon
as he finds himself in danger he ejects,
to a great distance from behind, a
small stream of water, of so subtile a nature,
and at the same time of so powerful
a smell, that the air is tainted with
it for half a mile in circumference; and
his pursuers, whether men or dogs, being
almost suffocated with the stench, are
obliged to give over the pursuit. On this
account he is called by the French, Enfant
du Diable, the Child of the Devil;
or Bête Puante, the Stinking Beast. It
is almost impossible to describe the
noisome effects of the liquid with which
this creature is supplied by nature for its
defence. If a drop of it falls on your
cloaths, they are rendered so disagreeable
that it is impossible ever after to wear
them; or if any of it enters your eyelids,
<span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span>the pain becomes intolerable for a long
time, and perhaps at last you lose your
sight. The smell of the skunk, though
thus to be dreaded, is not like that of a
putrid carcase, but a strong fœtid effluvia of
musk, which displeases rather from its penetrating
power than from its nauseousness.
It is notwithstanding considered as
conducive to clear the head and to raise
the spirits. This water is supposed by
naturalists to be its urine; but I have dissected
many of them that I have shot, and
have found within their bodies, near the
urinal vessels, a small receptacle of water,
totally distinct from the bladder which
contained the urine, and from which alone
I am satisfied the horrid stench proceeds.
After having taken out with great care
the bag wherein this water is lodged, I
have frequently fed on them, and have
found them very sweet and good; but
one drop emitted taints not only the carcase,
but the whole house, and renders
every kind of provisions that are in it unfit
for use. With great justice therefore
do the French give it such a diabolical
name.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span>The PORCUPINE. The body of
an American porcupine is in bulk about
the size of a small dog, but it is both
shorter in length, and not so high from
the ground. It varies very much from
those of other countries both in its shape
and the length of its quills. The former
is like that of a fox, except the head,
which is not so sharp and long, but resembles
more that of a rabbit. Its body
is covered with hair of a dark brown,
about four inches long, great part of
which are the thickness of a straw, and
are termed its quills. These are white,
with black points, hollow, and very
strong, especially those that grow on the
back. The quills serve this creature for
offensive and defensive weapons, which
he darts at his enemies, and if they pierce
the flesh in the least degree, they will
sink quite into it, and are not to be extracted
without incision. The Indians
use them for boring their ears and noses
to insert their pendants, and also by way
of ornament to their stockings, hair, &amp;c.
besides which they greatly esteem the
flesh.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='454' id='Page_454'></span>The WOOD-CHUCK is a ground
animal of the fur kind, about the size of
a martin, being nearly fifteen inches
long; its body however is rounder, and
his legs shorter; the fore paws of it are
broad, and constructed for the purpose of
digging holes in the ground, where it
burrows like a rabbit; its fur is of a grey
colour on the reddish cast, and its flesh
tolerable food.</p>

<p class='c000'>The RACOON is somewhat less in
size than a beaver, and its feet and legs
are like those of that creature, but short
in proportion to its body, which resembles
that of a badger. The shape of its
head is much like a fox’s, only the ears
are shorter, more round and naked; and
its hair is also similar to that animal’s, being
thick, long, soft, and black at the
ends. On its face there is a broad stripe
that runs across it, and includes the eyes,
which are large. Its muzzle is black,
and at the end roundish like that of a dog;
the teeth are also similar to those of a dog
in number and shape; the tail is long and
round, with annular stripes on it like
those of a cat; the feet have five long
slender toes armed with sharp claws, by
<span class='pageno' title='455' id='Page_455'></span>which it is enabled to climb up trees like
a monkey, and to run to the very extremities
of the boughs. It makes use of its
fore feet in the manner of hands, and
feeds itself with them. The flesh of this
creature is very good in the months of
September and October, when fruit and
nuts, on which it likes to feed, are
plenty.</p>

<p class='c000'>The MARTIN is rather larger than a
squirrel, and somewhat of the same make;
its legs and claws however are considerably
shorter. Its ears are short, broad,
and roundish, and its eyes shine in the
night like those of a cat. The whole
body is covered with fur of a brownish
fallow colour, and there are some in the
more northern parts which are black; the
skins of the latter are of much greater
value than the others. The tail is covered
with long hair, which makes it appear
thicker than it really is. Its flesh
is sometimes eaten, but is not in any great
esteem.</p>

<p class='c000'>The MUSQUASH, or MUSK-RAT,
is so termed for the exquisite musk which
it affords. It appears to be a diminutive
of the beaver, being endowed with all the
<span class='pageno' title='456' id='Page_456'></span>properties of that sagacious animal, and
wants nothing but size and strength,
being not much bigger than a large rat of
the Norway breed, to rival the creature
it so much resembles. Was it not for its
tail, which is exactly the same as that of
an European rat, the structure of their
bodies is so much alike, especially the
head, that it might be taken for a small
beaver. Like that creature it builds itself a
cabbin, but of a less perfect construction,
and takes up its abode near the side of
some piece of water. In the spring they
leave their retreats, and in pairs subsist on
leaves and roots till the summer comes
on, when they feed on strawberries, rasberries,
and such other fruits as they can
reach. At the approach of winter they
separate, when each takes up its lodging
apart by itself in some hollow of a tree,
where they remain quite unprovided with
food, and there is the greatest reason to
believe, subsist without any till the return
of spring.</p>

<p class='c000'>SQUIRRELS. There are five sorts
of squirrels in America; the red, the
grey, the black, the variegated, and the
flying. The two former are exactly the
<span class='pageno' title='457' id='Page_457'></span>same as those of Europe; the black are
somewhat larger, and differ from them
only in colour; the variegated also resemble
them in shape and figure, but
are very beautiful, being finely striped
with white or grey, and sometimes with
red and black. The American flying
squirrel is much less than the European,
being not above five inches long, and of
a russet grey or ash-colour on the back,
and white on the under parts. It has
black prominent eyes like those of the
mouse, with a long flat broad tail. By
a membrane on each side which reaches
from its fore to its hind legs, this creature
is enabled to leap from one tree to
another, even if they stand a considerable
distance apart; this loose skin, which it
is enabled to stretch out like a sail, and
by which it is buoyed up, is about two
inches broad, and is covered with a fine
hair or down. It feeds upon the same
provisions as the others, and is easily
tamed.</p>

<p class='c000'>The BEAVER. This creature has
been so often treated of, and his uncommon
abilities so minutely described, that
any further account of it will appear unnecessary;
<span class='pageno' title='458' id='Page_458'></span>however for the benefit of those
of my readers who are not so well acquainted
with the form and properties of
this sagacious and useful animal, I shall
give a concise description of it. The
beaver is an amphibious quadruped, which
cannot live for any long time in the water,
and it is said is even able to exist
entirely without it, provided it has the
convenience of sometimes bathing itself.
The largest beavers are nearly four feet
in length, and about fourteen or fifteen
inches in breadth over the haunches; they
weigh about sixty pounds. Its head is
like that of the otter, but larger; its
snout is pretty long, the eyes small, the
ears short, round, hairy on the outside,
and smooth within, and its teeth very
long; the under teeth stand out of their
mouths about the breadth of three fingers,
and the upper half a finger, all of which
are broad, crooked, strong, and sharp;
besides those teeth called the incisors,
which grow double, are set very deep in
their jaws, and bend like the edge of an
axe, they have sixteen grinders, eight on
each side, four above and four below, directly
opposite to each other. With the
<span class='pageno' title='459' id='Page_459'></span>former they are able to cut down trees
of a considerable size, with the latter to
break the hardest substances. Its legs are
short, particularly the fore legs, which
are only four or five inches long, and not
unlike those of a badger; the toes of the
fore feet are separate, the nails placed obliquely,
and are hollow like quills; but
the hind feet are quite different, and furnished
with membranes between the toes.
By this means it can walk, though but
slowly, and is able to swim with as much
ease as any other aquatic animal. The
tail has somewhat in it that resembles a
fish, and seems to have no manner of relation
to the rest of the body, except the
hind feet, all the other parts being similar
to those of land animals. The tail is
covered with a skin furnished with scales,
that are joined together by a pellicle;
these scales are about the thickness of
parchment, nearly a line and a half in
length, and generally of a hexagonical
figure, having six corners; it is about
eleven or twelve inches in length, and
broader in the middle, where it is four
inches over, than either at the root or
the extremity. It is about two inches
<span class='pageno' title='460' id='Page_460'></span>thick near the body, where it is almost
round, and grows gradually thinner and
flatter to the end. The colour of the
beaver is different according to the different
climates in which it is found. In the
most northern parts they are generally
quite black; in more temperate, brown;
their colour becoming lighter and lighter
as they approach towards the south. The
fur is of two sorts all over the body, except
at the feet, where it is very short; that
which is the longest is generally in length
about an inch, but on the back it sometimes
extends to two inches, gradually
diminishing towards the head and tail.
This part of the fur is harsh, coarse, and
shining, and of little use; the other part
consists of a very thick and fine down, so
soft that it feels almost like silk, about
three quarters of an inch in length, and is
what is commonly manufactured. Castor,
which is useful in medicine, is produced
from the body of this creature; it
was formerly believed to be its testicles,
but later discoveries have shown that it is
contained in four bags situated in the
lower belly. Two of which, that are
called the superior from their being more
<span class='pageno' title='461' id='Page_461'></span>elevated than the others, are filled with a
soft resinous adhesive matter, mixed with
small fibres, greyish without, and yellow
within, of a strong, disagreeable, and penetrating
scent, and very inflammable.
This is the true castoreum; it hardens in
the air, and becomes brown, brittle, and
friable. The inferior bags contain an
unctuous liquor like honey; the colour
of which is a pale yellow, and its odour
somewhat different from the other, being
rather weaker and more disagreeable; it
however thickens as it grows older, and
at length becomes about the consistence of
tallow. This has also its particular use in
medicine, but it is not so valuable as the
true castoreum.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ingenuity of these creatures in
building their cabbins, and in providing
for their subsistence, is truly wonderful.
When they are about to chuse themselves
a habitation, they assemble in companies
sometimes of two or three hundred, and
after mature deliberation fix on a place
where plenty of provisions, and all necessaries
are to be found. Their houses are
always situated in the water, and when
they can find neither lake nor pond adjacent,
<span class='pageno' title='462' id='Page_462'></span>they endeavour to supply the defect
by stopping the current of some brook or
small river, by means of a causeway or
dam. For this purpose they set about
felling of trees, and they take care to
chuse out those that grow above the place
where they intend to build, that they
might swim down with the current. Having
fixed on those that are proper, three
or four beavers placing themselves round
a large one, find means with their strong
teeth to bring it down. They also prudently
contrive that it shall fall towards
the water, that they may have the less
way to carry it. After they have by a
continuance of the same labour and industry,
cut it into proper lengths, they
roll these into the water, and navigate
them towards the place where they are
to be employed. Without entering more
minutely into the measures they pursue
in the construction of their dams, I shall
only remark, that having prepared a kind
of mortar with their feet, and laid it on
with their tails, which they had before
made use of to transport it to the place
where it is requisite, they construct them
with as much solidity and regularity as
<span class='pageno' title='463' id='Page_463'></span>the most experienced workmen could do.
The formation of their cabins is no less
amazing. These are either built on piles in
the middle of the small lakes they have
thus formed, on the bank of a river, or
at the extremity of some point of land
that advances into a lake. The figure of
them is round or oval, and they are fashioned
with an ingenuity equal to their
dams. Two thirds of the edifice stands
above the water, and this part is sufficiently
capacious to contain eight or ten
inhabitants. Each beaver has his place,
assigned him, the floor of which he curiously
strews with leaves, or small branches
of the pine tree, so as to render it clean
and comfortable; and their cabbins are
all situated so contiguous to each other,
as to allow of an easy communication.
The winter never surprizes these animals
before their business is completed; for by
the latter end of September their houses
are finished, and their stock of provisions
are generally laid in. These consist of
small pieces of wood whose texture is soft,
such as the poplar, the aspin, or willow,
&amp;c. which they lay up in piles, and dispose
of in such manner as to preserve their
<span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span>moisture. Was I to enumerate every instance
of sagacity that is to be discovered
in these animals, they would fill a volume,
and prove not only entertaining but
instructive.</p>

<p class='c000'>The OTTER. This creature also is
amphibious, and greatly resembles a beaver,
but is very different from it in many respects.
Its body is nearly as long as a beaver’s,
but considerably less in all its parts.
The muzzle, eyes, and the form of the
head are nearly the same, but the teeth are
very unlike, for the otter wants the large
incisors or nippers that a beaver has; instead
of these, all his teeth, without any
distinction, are shaped like those of a dog
or wolf. The hair also of the former is
not half so long as that belonging to the
latter, nor is the colour of it exactly the
same, for the hair of an otter under the
neck, stomach, and belly, is more greyish
than that of a beaver, and in many other
respects it likewise varies. This animal,
which is met with in most parts of the
world, but in much greater numbers in
North America, is very mischievous, and
when he is closely pursued, will not only
attack dogs but men. It generally feeds
<span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span>upon fish, especially in the summer, but
in the winter is contented with the bark
of trees, or the produce of the fields. Its
flesh both tastes and smells of fish, and is
not wholsome food, though it is sometimes
eaten through necessity.</p>

<p class='c000'>The MINK is of the otter kind, and
subsists in the same manner. In shape
and size it resembles a pole-cat, being
equally long and slender. Its skin is
blacker than that of an otter, or almost
any other creature; “as black as a mink,”
being a proverbial expression in America;
it is not however so valuable, though this
greatly depends on the season in which it
is taken. Its tail is round like that of a
snake, but growing flattish towards the
end, and is entirely without hair. An
agreeable musky scent exhales from its
body; and it is met with near the sources
of rivers on whose banks it chiefly lives.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>OF THE BIRDS.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The Eagle, the Hawk, the Night
Hawk, the Fish Hawk, the Whipperwill,
the Raven, the Crow, the Owl, Parrots,
the Pelican, the Crane, the Stork, the
Cormorant, the Heron, the Swan, the
Goose, Ducks, Teal, the Loon, the Water-Hen,
the Turkey, the Heath Cock, the
Partridge, the Quail, Pigeons, the Snipe,
Larks, the Woodpecker, the Cuckoo, the
Blue Jay, the Swallow, the Wakon Bird,
the Black Bird, the Red Bird, the Thrush,
the Whetsaw, the Nightingale, the King
Bird, the Robin, the Wren, and the Humming
Bird.</p>

<p class='c009'>The EAGLE. There are only two
sorts of eagles in these parts, the bald and
the grey, which are much the same in size,
and similar to the shape of those of other
countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The NIGHT HAWK. This Bird is
of the hawk species, its bill being crooked,
its wings formed for swiftness, and its
shape nearly like that of the common
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span>hawk; but in size it is considerably less,
and in colour rather darker. It is scarcely
ever seen but in the evening, when, at
the approach of twilight, it flies about,
and darts itself in wanton gambols at the
head of the belated traveller. Before a
thunder-shower these birds are seen at an
amazing height in the air assembled together
in great numbers, as swallows are
observed to do on the same occasion.</p>

<p class='c000'>The WHIPPERWILL, or, as it is
termed by the Indians, the Muckawiss.
This extraordinary bird is somewhat like
the last-mentioned in its shape and colour,
only it has some whitish stripes across the
wings, and like that is seldom ever seen
till after sun-set. It also is never met with
but during the spring and summer months.
As soon as the Indians are informed by its
notes of its return, they conclude that the
frost is entirely gone, in which they are
seldom deceived; and on receiving this assurance
of milder weather, begin to sow
their corn. It acquires its name by the
noise it makes, which to the people of the
colonies sounds like the name they give it,
Whipper-will; to an Indian ear Muck-a-wiss.
The words, it is true, are not alike,
<span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span>but in this manner they strike the imagination
of each; and the circumstance is a
proof that the same sounds, if they are not
rendered certain by being reduced to the
rules of orthography, might convey different
ideas to different people. As soon
as night comes on, these birds will place
themselves on the fences, stumps, or
stones that lie near some house, and repeat
their melancholy notes without any
variation till midnight. The Indians, and
some of the inhabitants of the back settlements,
think if this bird perches upon any
house, that it betokens some mishap to
the inhabitants of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The FISH HAWK greatly resembles
the latter in its shape, and receives his
name from his food, which is generally
fish; it skims over the lakes and rivers,
and sometimes seems to lie expanded on
the water, as he hovers so close to it, and
having by some attractive power drawn
the fish within its reach, darts suddenly
upon them. The charm it makes use of
is supposed to be an oil contained in a
small bag in the body, and which nature
has by some means or other supplied him
with the power of using for this purpose;
<span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span>it is however very certain that any bait
touched with a drop of the oil collected
from this bird is an irresistible lure for all
sorts of fish, and insures the angler great
success.</p>

<p class='c000'>The OWL. The only sort of owls
that is found on the banks of the Mississippi
is extremely beautiful in its plumage,
being of a fine deep yellow or gold colour,
pleasingly shaded and spotted.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CRANE. There is a kind of
crane in these parts, which is called by
Father Hennepin a pelican, that is about
the size of the European crane, of a greyish
colour, and with long legs; but this
species differs from all others in its bill,
which is about twelve inches long, and
one inch and half broad, of which breadth
it continues to the end, where it is blunted,
and round like a paddle; its tongue
is of the same length.</p>

<p class='c000'>DUCKS. Among a variety of wild
ducks, the different species of which
amount to upwards of twenty, I shall
confine my description to one sort, that
is, the wood duck, or, as the French
term it, Canard branchus. This fowl receives
its name from its frequenting the
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>woods, and perching on the branches of
trees, which no other kind of water fowl
(a characteristic that this still preserves) is
known to do. It is nearly of a size with
other ducks; its plumage is beautifully
variegated, and very brilliant. The flesh
of it also, as it feeds but little on fish, is
finely flavoured, and much superior to
any other sort.</p>

<p class='c000'>The TEAL. I have already remarked
in my Journal, that the teal found on the
Fox River, and the head branches of the
Mississippi, are perhaps not to be equalled
for the fatness and delicacy of their flesh by
any other in the world. In colour, shape,
and size they are very little different from
those found in other countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The LOON is a water fowl, somewhat
less than a teal, and is a species of
the dobchick. Its wings are short, and
its legs and feet large in proportion to the
body; the colour of it is a dark brown,
nearly approaching to black; and as it
feeds only on fish, the flesh of it is very
ill-flavoured. These birds are exceedingly
nimble and expert at diving, so that it is
almost impossible for one person to shoot
them, as they will dextrously avoid the
<span class='pageno' title='471' id='Page_471'></span>shot by diving before they reach them; so
that it requires three persons to kill one
of them, and this can only be done the
moment it raises his head out of the water
as it returns to the surface after diving.
It however only repays the trouble
taken to obtain it, by the excellent sport
it affords.</p>

<p class='c000'>The PARTRIDGE. There are three
sorts of partridges here, the brown, the
red, and the black, the first of which are
most esteemed. They are all much larger
than the European partridges, being nearly
the size of a hen pheasant; their head and
eyes are also like that bird, and they have
all long tails, which they spread like a
fan, but not erect; but contrary to the
custom of those in other countries, they
will perch on the branches of the poplar
and black birch, on the buds of which
they feed early in the morning and in the
twilight of the evening during the winter
months, when they are easily shot.</p>

<p class='c000'>The WOOD PIGEON, is nearly the
same as ours, and there is such prodigious
quantities of them on the banks of the
Mississippi, that they will sometimes darken
the sun for several minutes.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>The WOODPECKER. This is a
very beautiful bird; there is one sort
whose feathers are a mixture of various
colours; and another that is brown all
over the body, except the head and neck,
which are of a fine red. As this bird is
supposed to make a greater noise than ordinary
at particular times, it is conjectured
his cries then denote rain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The BLUE JAY. This bird is shaped
nearly like the European jay, only that
its tail is longer. On the top of its head
is a crest of blue feathers, which is raised
or let down at pleasure. The lower part
of the neck behind, and the back, are of
a purplish colour, and the upper sides of
the wings and tail, as well as the lower
part of the back and rump, are of a fine
blue; the extremities of the wings are
blackish, faintly tinctured with dark blue
on the edges, whilst the other parts of
the wing are barred across with black in
an elegant manner. Upon the whole this
bird can scarcely be exceeded in beauty by
any of the winged inhabitants of this or
other climates. It has the same jetting
motion that jays generally have, and its
cry is far more pleasing.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span>The WAKON BIRD, as it is termed
by the Indians, appears to be of the same
species as the birds of paradise. The
name they have given it is expressive of
its superior excellence, and the veneration
they have for it; the wakon bird being
in their language the bird of the Great
Spirit. It is nearly the size of a swallow,
of a brown colour, shaded about the neck
with a bright green; the wings are of a
darker brown than the body; its tail is
composed of four or five feathers, which
are three times as long as its body, and
which are beautifully shaded with green
and purple. It carries this fine length of
plumage in the same manner as a peacock
does, but it is not known whether it ever
raises it into the erect position that bird
sometimes does. I never saw any of these
birds in the colonies, but the Naudowessie
Indians caught several of them when I
was in their country, and seemed to treat
them as if they were of a superior rank
to any other of the feathered race.</p>

<p class='c000'>The BLACK BIRD. There are three
sorts of birds in North America that bear
this name; the first is the common, or
as it is there termed, the crow blackbird,
<span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>which is quite black, and of the same
size and shape of those in Europe, but it
has not that melody in its notes which
they have. In the month of September
this sort fly in large flights, and do great
mischief to the Indian corn, which is at
that time just ripe. The second sort is
the red-wing, which is rather smaller
than the first species, but like that it is
black all over its body, except on the
lower rim of the wings, where it is of a
fine bright full scarlet. It builds its nest,
and chiefly resorts among the small bushes
that grow in meadows and low swampy
places. It whistles a few notes, but is
not equal in its song to the European
blackbird. The third sort is of the same
size as the latter, and is jet black like that,
but all the upper part of the wing, just
below the back, is of a fine clear white;
as if nature intended to diversify the species,
and to atone for the want of a melodious
pipe by the beauty of its plumage;
for this also is deficient in its musical
powers. The beaks of every sort are of
a full yellow, and the females of each of
a rusty black like the European.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span>The RED BIRD is about the size of
a sparrow, but with a long tail, and is
all over of a bright vermilion colour. I
saw many of them about the Ottawaw
Lakes, but I could not learn that they
sung. I also observed in some other parts,
a bird of much the same make, that was
entirely of a fine yellow.</p>

<p class='c000'>The WHETSAW is of the cuckoo
kind, being like that, a solitary bird,
and scarcely ever seen. In the summer
months it is heard in the groves, where
it makes a noise like the filing of a saw;
from which it receives its name.</p>

<p class='c000'>The KING BIRD is like a swallow,
and seems to be of the same species as
the black martin or swift. It is called
the King Bird because it is able to master
almost every bird that flies. I have often
seen it bring down a hawk.</p>

<p class='c000'>The HUMMING BIRD. This beautiful
bird, which is the smallest of the
feathered inhabitants of the air, is about
the third part the size of a wren, and is
shaped extremely like it. Its legs, which
are about an inch long, appear like two
small needles, and its body is proportionable
to them. But its plumage exceeds
<span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>description. On its head it has a small
tuft of a jetty shining black; the breast
of it is red, the belly white, the back,
wings, and tail of the finest pale green;
and small specks of gold are scattered
with inexpressible grace over the whole:
besides this, an almost imperceptible down
softens the colours, and produces the
most pleasing shades. With its bill,
which is of the same diminutive size as
the other parts of its body, it extracts
from the flowers a moisture which is its
nourishment; over these it hovers like a
bee, but never lights on them, moving
at the same time its wings with such velocity
that the motion of them is imperceptible;
notwithstanding which they
make a humming noise, from whence it
receives its name.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><i>Of the</i> FISHES <i>which are found in the waters of the Mississippi</i>.</h3>

<p class='c016'>I have already given a description of
those that are taken in the great lakes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sturgeon, the Pout or Cat Fish,
the Pike, the Carp, and the Chub.</p>
<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span>The STURGEON. The fresh
water sturgeon is shaped in no other
respect like those taken near the sea, except
in the formation of its head and
tail; which are fashioned in the same
manner, but the body is not so angulated,
nor are there so many horny scales
about it as on the latter. Its length is
generally about two feet and a half or
three feet long, but in circumference not
proportionable, being a slender fish. The
flesh is exceedingly delicate and finely flavoured;
I caught some in the head waters
of the river St. Croix that far exceeded
trout. The manner of taking them is
by watching them as they lie under
the banks in a clear stream, and darting
at them with a fish-spear; for they will
not take a bait. There is also in the
Mississippi, and there only, another sort
than the species I have described, which
is similar to it in every respect, except
that the upper jaw extends fourteen or
fifteen inches beyond the under; this extensive
jaw, which is of a gristly substance,
is three inches and half broad, and continues
of that breadth, somewhat in the shape of
an oar, to the end, which is flat. The
<span class='pageno' title='478' id='Page_478'></span>flesh of this fish, however, is not to
be compared with the other sort, and
is not so much esteemed even by the
Indians.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CAT FISH. This fish is about
eighteen inches long; of a brownish colour
and without scales. It has a large
round head, from whence it receives its
name, on different parts of which grow
three or four strong sharp horns about two
inches long. Its fins are also very bony
and strong, and without great care will
pierce the hands of those who take them.
It weighs commonly about five or six
pounds; the flesh of it is excessively fat
and luscious, and greatly resembles that of
an eel in its flavour.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CARP and CHUB are much the
same as those in England, and nearly
about the same in size.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>OF SERPENTS.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Rattle Snake, the Long Black
Snake, the Wall or House Adder, the
Striped or Garter Snake, the Water
Snake, the Hissing Snake, the Green
<span class='pageno' title='479' id='Page_479'></span>Snake, the Thorn-tail Snake, the Speckled
Snake, the Ring Snake, the Two-headed
Snake.</p>
<p class='c009'>The RATTLE SNAKE. There appears
to be two species of this reptile;
one of which is commonly termed the
Black, and the other the Yellow; and of
these the latter is generally considered as
the largest. At their full growth they
are upwards of five feet long, and the
middle part of the body at which it is of
the greatest bulk, measures about nine
inches round. From that part it gradually
decreases both towards the head and
the tail. The neck is proportionably very
small, and the head broad and depressed.
These are of a light brown colour, the
iris of the eye red, and all the upper part
of the body brown, mixed with a ruddy
yellow, and chequered with many regular
lines of a deep black, gradually shading
towards a gold colour. In short the
whole of this dangerous reptile is very
beautiful, and could it be viewed with
less terror, such a variegated arrangement
of colours would be extremely
pleasing. But these are only to be seen
<span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span>in their highest perfection at the time this
creature is animated by resentment; then
every tint rushes from its subcutaneous
recess, and gives the surface of the skin
a deeper stain. The belly is of a palish
blue, which grows fuller as it approaches
the sides, and is at length intermixed
with the colour of the upper part. The
rattle at its tail, from which it receives
its name, is composed of a firm, dry,
callous, or horny substance of a light
brown, and consists of a number of cells
which articulate one within another like
joints; and which increase every year
and make known the age of the creature.
These articulations being very loose, the
included points strike against the inner
surface of the concave parts or rings into
which they are admitted, and as the
snake vibrates or shakes its tail, makes a
rattling noise. This alarm it always gives
when it is apprehensive of danger; and in
an instant after forms itself into a spiral
wreath, in the centre of which appears the
head erect, and breathing forth vengeance
against either man or beast that shall dare
to come near it. In this attitude he awaits
<span class='pageno' title='481' id='Page_481'></span>the approach of his enemies, rattling his
tail as he sees or hears them coming on.
By this timely intimation, which heaven
seems to have provided as a means
to counteract the mischief this venomous
reptile would otherwise be the perpetrator
of, the unwary traveller is apprized
of his danger, and has an opportunity
of avoiding it. It is however to be
observed, that it never acts offensively;
it neither pursues or flies from any thing
that approaches it, but lies in the position
described, rattling his tail as if reluctant
to hurt. The teeth with which this serpent
effects his poisonous purposes are not
those he makes use of on ordinary occasions,
they are only two in number,
very small and sharp pointed, and fixed
in a sinewy substance that lies near the
extremity of the upper jaw, resembling
the claws of a cat; at the root of each
of these, which might be extended, contracted,
or entirely hidden, as need requires,
are two small bladders which nature
has so constructed, that at the same
instant an incision is made by the teeth,
a drop of a greenish poisonous liquid enters
the wound, and taints with its destructive
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span>quality the whole mass of blood.
In a moment the unfortunate victim of its
wrath feels a chilly tremor run through
all his frame; a swelling immediately begins
on the spot where the teeth had entered,
which spreads by degrees over the
whole body, and produces on every part
of the skin the variegated hue of the
snake. The bite of this reptile is more
or less venomous according to the season
of the year in which it is given. In the
dog-days, it often proves instantly mortal,
and especially if the wound is made
among the sinews situated in the back-part
of the leg above the heel; but in
the spring, in autumn, or during a cool
day which might happen in the summer,
its bad effects are to be prevented by the
immediate application of proper remedies;
and these Providence has bounteously supplied,
by causing the Rattle Snake Plantain,
an approved antidote to the poison
of this creature, to grow in great profusion
where-ever they are to be met
with. There are likewise several other
remedies besides this, for the venom of its
bite. A decoction made of the buds or
bark of the white ash taken internally
<span class='pageno' title='483' id='Page_483'></span>prevents <a id='its'></a>its pernicious effects. Salt is a
newly discovered remedy, and if applied
immediately to the part, or the wound be
washed with brine, a cure might be assured.
The fat of the reptile also rubbed
on it is frequently found to be very efficacious.
But though the lives of the persons
who have been bitten might be preserved
by these, and their health in some
degree restored, yet they annually experience
a slight return of the dreadful symptoms
about the time they received the instillation.
However remarkable it may
appear it is certain, that though the venom
of this creature affects in a greater or
less degree all animated nature, the hog
is an exception to the rule, as that animal
will readily destroy them without dreading
their poisonous fangs, and fatten on
their flesh. It has been often observed,
and I can confirm the observation, that
the Rattle Snake is charmed with any
harmonious sounds, whether vocal or instrumental;
I have many times seen them
even when they have been enraged, place
themselves in a listening posture, and
continue immoveably attentive and susceptible
of delight all the time the musick
<span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span>has lasted. I should have remarked, that
when the Rattle Snake bites, it drops
its under jaw, and holding the upper jaw
erect, throws itself in a curve line, with
great force, and as quick as lightning, on
the object of its resentment. In a moment
after, it returns again to its defensive
posture, having disengaged its teeth
from the wound with great celerity, by
means of the position in which it had
placed its head when it made the attack.
It never extends itself to a greater distance
than half its length will reach, and though
it sometimes repeats the blow two or three
times, it as often returns with a <a id='sudden'></a>sudden rebound
to its former state. The Black
Rattle Snake differs in no other respect from
the yellow, than in being rather smaller,
and in the variegation of its colours, which
are exactly reversed: one is black where
the other is yellow, and vice versa. They
are equally venomous. It is not known
how these creatures engender; I have
often found the eggs of several other species
of the snake, but notwithstanding no
one has taken more pains to acquire a perfect
knowledge of every property of these
reptiles than myself, I never could discover
<span class='pageno' title='485' id='Page_485'></span>the manner in which they bring
forth their young. I once killed a female
that had seventy young ones in its
belly, but these were perfectly formed, and
I saw them just before retire to the mouth
of their mother, as a place of security, on
my approach. The gall of this serpent,
mixed with chalk, are formed into little
balls, and exported from America, for medicinal
purposes. They are of the nature
of Gascoign’s powders, and are an excellent
remedy for complaints incident to children.
The flesh of the snake also dried, and made
into broth, is much more nutritive than
that of vipers, and very efficacious against
consumptions.</p>

<p class='c000'>The LONG BLACK SNAKE. These
are also of two sorts, both of which are
exactly similar in shape and size, only the
belly of one is a light red, the other a
faint blue; all the upper parts of their bodies
are black and scaly. They are in
general from six to eight feet in length,
and carry their heads, as they crawl along,
about a foot and an half from the ground.
They easily climb the highest trees in
pursuit of birds and squirrels, which are
their chief food; and these, it is said,
<span class='pageno' title='486' id='Page_486'></span>they charm by their looks, and render incapable
of escaping from them. Their
appearance carries terror with it to those
who are unacquainted with their inability
to hurt, but they are perfectly inoffensive
and free from venom.</p>

<p class='c000'>The STRIPED or GARTER SNAKE
is exactly the same as that species found in
other climates.</p>

<p class='c000'>The WATER SNAKE is much like
the Rattle Snake in shape and size, but is
not endowed with the same venomous
powers, being quite harmless.</p>

<p class='c000'>The HISSING SNAKE I have already
particularly described, when I treated,
in my Journal, of Lake Erie.</p>

<p class='c000'>The GREEN SNAKE is about a foot
and an half long, and in colour so near to
grass and herbs, that it cannot be discovered
as it lies on the ground; happily however
it is free from venom, otherwise it would
do an infinite deal of mischief, as those
who pass through the meadows, not being
able to perceive it, are deprived of the
power of avoiding it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The THORN-TAIL SNAKE. This
reptile is found in many parts of America,
but it is very seldom to be seen. It is of
<span class='pageno' title='487' id='Page_487'></span>a middle size, and receives its name from a
thorn-like dart in its tail, with which it
is said to inflict a mortal wound.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SPECKLED SNAKE is an aqueous
reptile about two feet and an half in
length, but without venom. Its skin, which
is brown and white with some spots of yellow
in it, is used by the Americans as a
cover for the handles of whips, and it
renders them very pleasing to the sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>The RING SNAKE is about twelve
inches long; the body of it is entirely
black, except a yellow ring which it has
about its neck, and which appears like a
narrow piece of riband tied around it. This
odd reptile is frequently found in the bark
of trees, and among old logs.</p>

<p class='c000'>The TWO-HEADED SNAKE. The
only snake of this kind that was ever seen
in America, was found about the year
1762, near Lake Champlain, by Mr. Park,
a gentleman of New England, and made a
present to lord Amherst. It was about a
foot long, and in shape like the common
snake, but it was furnished with two
heads exactly similar, which united at the
neck. Whether this was a distinct species
of snakes, and was able to propagate its
<span class='pageno' title='488' id='Page_488'></span>likeness, or whether it was an accidental
formation, I know not.</p>

<p class='c000'>The TORTOISE or LAND TURTLE.
The shape of this creature is so
well known that it is unnecessary to describe
it. There are seven or eight sorts
of them in America, some of which are
beautifully variegated, even beyond description.
The shells of many have spots of
red, green, and yellow in them, and the
chequer work is composed of small squares,
curiously disposed. The most beautiful sort
of these creatures are the smallest, and the
bite of them is said to be venomous.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>LIZARDS, &amp;c.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Though there are numerous kinds of
this class of the animal creation in the
country I treat of, I shall only take notice
of two of them; which are termed the
Swift and the Slow Lizard.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SWIFT LIZARD is about six
inches long, and has four legs and a tail.
Its body, which is blue, is prettily striped
with dark lines shaded with yellow; but
the end of the tail is totally blue. It is
<span class='pageno' title='489' id='Page_489'></span>so remarkably agile that in an instant it
is out of sight, nor can its movement be
perceived by the quickest eye: so that it
might more justly be said to vanish, than
to run away. This species are supposed
to poison those they bite, but are not dangerous,
as they never attack persons that
approach them, chusing rather to get suddenly
out of their reach.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SLOW LIZARD is of the same
shape as the Swift, but its colour is brown;
it is moreover of an opposite disposition,
being altogether as slow in its movements
as the other is swift. It is remarkable
that these lizards are extremely brittle,
and will break off near the tail as easily as
an icicle.</p>

<p class='c000'>Among the reptiles of North America
there is a species of the toad termed the
TREE TOAD, which is nearly of the
same shape as the common sort, but smaller
and with longer claws. It is usually
found on trees, sticking close to the bark,
or lying in the crevices of it; and so
nearly does it resemble the colour of the
tree to which it cleaves, that it is with
difficulty distinguished from it. These
creatures are only heard during the twilight
<span class='pageno' title='490' id='Page_490'></span>of the morning and evening, or just
before and after a shower of rain, when
they make a croaking noise somewhat
shriller than that of a frog, which might
be heard to a great distance. They infest
the woods in such numbers, that their responsive
notes at these times make the air
resound. It is only a summer animal,
and never to be found during the winter.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>INSECTS.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The interior parts of North America
abound with nearly the same insects as are
met with in the same parallels of latitude;
and the species of them are so numerous
and diversified that even a succinct description
of the whole of them would fill a
volume; I shall therefore confine myself
to a few, which I believe are almost peculiar
to this country; the Silk Worm,
the Tobacco Worm, the Bee, the Lightning
Bug, the Water Bug, and the Horned
Bug.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SILK WORM is nearly the same
as those of France and Italy, but will not
produce the same quantity of silk.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='491' id='Page_491'></span>The TOBACCO WORM is a caterpillar
of the size and figure of a silk worm,
it is of a fine sea-green colour, on its rump
it has a sting or horn near a quarter of an
inch long.</p>

<p class='c000'>The BEES, in America, principally
lodge their honey in the earth to secure it
from the ravages of the bears, who are remarkably
fond of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The LIGHTNING BUG or FIRE
FLY is about the size of a bee, but it is
of the beetle kind, having like that insect
two pair of wings, the upper of
which are of a firm texture, to defend it
from danger. When it flies, and the
wings are expanded, there is under these a
kind of coat, constructed also like wings,
which is luminous; and as the insect
passes on, causes all the hinder part of its
body to appear like a bright fiery coal.
Having placed one of them on your hand,
the under part only shines, and throws
the light on the space beneath; but as
soon as it spreads its upper wings to fly
away, the whole body which lies behind
them appears illuminated all around. The
light it gives is not constantly of the same
magnitude, even when it flies; but seems
<span class='pageno' title='492' id='Page_492'></span>to depend on the expansion or contraction
of the luminous coat or wings, and is
very different from that emitted in a dark
night by dry wood or some kinds of
fish, it having much more the appearance
of real fire. They seem to be sensible
of the power they are possessed of,
and to know the most suitable time for
exerting it, as in a very dark night they
are much more numerous than at any
other time. They are only seen during
the summer months of June, July, and
August, and then at no other time but
in the night. Whether from their colour,
which is a dusky brown, they
are not then discernible, or from their
retiring to holes and crevices, I know
not, but they are never to be discovered in
the day. They chiefly are seen in low
swampy land, and appear like innumerable
transient gleams of light. In dark
nights when there is much lightning,
without rain, they seem as if they wished
either to imitate or assist the flashes; for
during the intervals, they are uncommonly
agile, and endeavour to throw out
every ray they can collect. Notwithstanding
this effulgent appearance, these
<span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span>insects are perfectly harmless; you may permit
them to crawl upon your hand, when
five or six, if they freely exhibit their glow
together, will enable you to read almost
the smallest print.</p>

<p class='c000'>The WATER BUG is of a brown
colour, about the size of a pea, and in
shape nearly oval: it has many legs,
by means of which it passes over the surface
of the water with such incredible
swiftness that it seems to slide or dart itself
along.</p>

<p class='c000'>The HORNED BUG, or, as it is
sometimes termed, the STAG BEETLE,
is of a dusky brown colour nearly approaching
to black, about an inch and an
half long, and half an inch broad. It
has two large horns, which grow on each
side of the head, and meet horizontally,
and with these it pinches very hard; they
are branched like those of a stag, from
whence it receives its name. They fly
about in the evening, and prove very
troublesome to those who are in the fields
at that time.</p>

<p class='c000'>I must not omit that the LOCUST
is a septennial insect, as they are only
seen, a small number of stragglers excepted,
<span class='pageno' title='494' id='Page_494'></span>every seven years, when they infest
these parts and the interior colonies
in large swarms, and do a great deal of
mischief. The years when they thus arrive
are denominated the locust years.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX.<br /> <br /><i>Of the</i> <span class='sc'>Trees, Shrubs, Roots, Herbs, Flowers</span> <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_7 c006'>I SHALL here observe the same method
that I have pursued in the preceding
chapter, and having given a list
of the trees, &amp;c. which are natives of the
interior parts of North America, particularize
such only as differ from the produce
of other countries, or, being little
known, have not been described.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>OF TREES.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Oak, the Pine Tree, the Maple,
the Ash, the Hemlock, the Bass or
White Wood, the Cedar, the Elm, the
Birch, the Fir, the Locust Tree, the
<span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span>Poplar, the Wickopic or Suckwic, the
Spruce, the Hornbeam, and the Button
Wood Tree.</p>

<p class='c009'>The OAK. There are several sorts of
oaks in these parts; the black, the white,
the red, the yellow, the grey, the swamp
oak, and the chesnut oak: the five former
vary but little in their external appearance,
the shape of the leaves, and the
colour of the bark being so much alike,
that they are scarcely distinguishable; but
the body of the tree when sawed discovers
the variation, which chiefly consists
in the colour of the wood, they being
all very hard and proper for building.
The swamp oak differs materially from
the others both in the shape of the leaf,
which is smaller, and in the bark, which
is smoother; and likewise as it grows
only in a moist gravelly soil. It is
esteemed the toughest of all woods, being
so strong yet pliable, that it is often
made use of instead of whalebone, and is
equally serviceable. The chesnut oak also
is greatly different from the others, particularly
in the shape of the leaf, which
much resembles that of the chesnut-tree,
<span class='pageno' title='496' id='Page_496'></span>and for this reason it is so denominated.
It is neither so strong as the former species,
or so tough as the latter, but is of a
nature proper to be split into rails for
fences, in which state it will endure a considerable
time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The PINE TREE. That species of
the pine tree peculiar to this part of the
continent is the white, the quality of which
I need not describe, as the timber of it is so
well known under the name of deals. It
grows here in great plenty, to an amazing
height and size, and yields an excellent turpentine,
though not in such quantities as
those in the northern parts of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The MAPLE. Of this tree there are
two sorts, the hard and the soft, both
of which yield a luscious juice, from
which the Indians by boiling make very
good sugar. The sap of the former is
much richer and sweeter than the latter,
but the soft produces a greater quantity.
The wood of the hard maple is very
beautifully veined and curled, and when
wrought into cabinets, tables, gunstocks,
&amp;c. is greatly valued. That of the soft
sort differs in its texture, wanting the
variegated grain of the hard; it also
<span class='pageno' title='497' id='Page_497'></span>grows more strait and free from branches,
and is more easily split. It likewise may
be distinguished from the hard, as this
grows in meadows and low-lands, that on
the hills and up-lands. The leaves are
shaped alike, but those of the soft maple
are much the largest, and of a deeper
green.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ASH. There are several sorts of
this tree in these parts, but that to which
I shall confine my description, is the yellow
ash, which is only found near the
head branches of the Mississippi. This
tree grows to an amazing height, and the
body of it is so firm and sound, that the
French traders who go into that country
from Louisiana to purchase furs make of
them periaguays; this they do by excavating
them by fire, and when they
are completed, convey in them the produce
of their trade to New Orleans, where
they find a good market both for their
vessels and cargoes. The wood of this
tree greatly resembles that of the common
ash, but it might be distinguished from
any other tree by its bark; the ross or
outside bark being near eight inches thick,
and indented with furrows more than six
<span class='pageno' title='498' id='Page_498'></span>inches deep, which make those that are
arrived to a great bulk appear uncommonly
rough; and by this peculiarity
they may be readily known. The rind
or inside bark is of the same thickness as
that of other trees, but its colour is a fine
bright yellow; insomuch that if it is but
slightly handled, it will leave a stain on
the fingers, which cannot easily be
washed away; and if in the spring you
peel off the bark, and touch the sap,
which then rises between that and the
body of the tree, it will leave so deep a
tincture that it will require three or four
days to wear it off. Many useful qualities
belonging to this tree I doubt not
will be discovered in time, besides its
proving a valuable acquisition to the
dyer.</p>

<p class='c000'>The HEMLOCK TREE grows in
every part of America in a greater or less
degree. It is an ever-green of a very
large growth, and has leaves somewhat
like that of the yew; it is however quite
useless, and only an incumbrance to the
ground, the wood being of a very coarse
grain, and full of wind-shakes or cracks.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='499' id='Page_499'></span>The BASS or WHITE WOOD is a
tree of a middling size, and the whitest
and softest wood that grows; when quite
dry it swims on the water like a cork: in
the settlements the turners make of it
bowls, trenchers, and dishes, which wear
smooth, and will last a long time; but
when applied to any other purpose it is
far from durable.</p>

<p class='c000'>The WICKOPICK or SUCKWICK
appears to be a species of the white wood,
and is distinguished from it by a peculiar
quality in the bark, which when pounded
and moistened with a little water, instantly
becomes a matter of the consistence
and nature of size. With this the
Indians pay their canoes, and it greatly
exceeds pitch or any other material usually
appropriated to that purpose; for besides
its adhesive quality, it is of so oily
a nature, that the water cannot penetrate
through it, and its repelling power abates
not for a considerable time.</p>

<p class='c000'>The BUTTON WOOD is a tree of the
largest size, and might be distinguished
by its bark, which is quite smooth and
prettily mottled. The wood is very proper
for the use of cabinet-makers. It is
<span class='pageno' title='500' id='Page_500'></span>covered with small hard burs which
spring from the branches, that appear not
unlike buttons, and from these I believe
it receives its name.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>NUT TREES.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Butter or Oil Nut, the Walnut,
the Hazle Nut, the Beech Nut, the Pecan
Nut, the Chesnut, the Hickory.</p>
<p class='c009'>The BUTTER or OIL NUT. As
no mention has been made by any authors
of this nut, I shall be the more particular
in my account of it. The tree grows
in meadows where the soil is rich and
warm. The body of it seldom exceeds a
yard in circumference, is full of branches,
the twigs of which are short and blunt,
and its leaves resemble those of the walnut.
The nut has a shell like that fruit, which
when ripe is more furrowed, and more
easily cracked; it is also much longer
and larger than a walnut, and contains a
greater quantity of kernel, which is very
oily, and of a rich agreeable flavour. I am
persuaded that a much purer oil than that
<span class='pageno' title='501' id='Page_501'></span>of olives might be extracted from this nut.
The inside bark of this tree dyes a good
purple; and it is said, varies in its shade,
being either darker or lighter according to
the month in which it is gathered.</p>

<p class='c000'>The BEECH NUT. Though this tree
grows exactly like that of the same name
in Europe, yet it produces nuts equally
as good as <a id='chesnuts'></a>chesnuts; on which bears,
martins, squirrels, partridges, turkies,
and many other beasts and birds feed.
The nut is contained, whilst growing, in
an outside case like that of a chesnut, but
not so prickly; and the coat of the inside
shell is also smooth like that; only its
form is nearly triangular. Vast quantities
of them lie scattered about in the
woods, and supply with food great numbers
of the creatures just mentioned. The
leaves, which are white, continue on the
trees during the whole winter. A decoction
made of them is a certain and expeditious
cure for wounds which arise from
burning or scalding, as well as a restorative
for those members that are nipped by the
frost.</p>

<p class='c000'>The PECAN NUT is somewhat of the
walnut kind, but rather smaller than a
<span class='pageno' title='502' id='Page_502'></span>walnut, being about the size of a middling
acorn, and of an oval form; the
shell is easily cracked, and the kernel
shaped like that of a walnut. This tree
grows chiefly near the Illinois river.</p>

<p class='c000'>The HICKORY is also of the walnut
kind, and bears a fruit nearly like that
tree. There are several sorts of them,
which vary only in the colour of the
wood. Being of a very tough nature, the
wood is generally used for the handles of
axes, &amp;c. It is also very good fire-wood,
and as it burns an excellent sugar
distills from it.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>FRUIT TREES.</h3>

<p class='c016'>I need not to observe that these are all
the spontaneous productions of nature,
which have never received the advantages
of ingrafting, transplanting, or manuring.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Vine, the Mulberry Tree, the
Crab Apple Tree, the Plum Tree, the
Cherry Tree, and the Sweet Gum Tree.</p>
<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='503' id='Page_503'></span>The VINE is very common here, and
of three kinds; the first sort hardly deserves
the name of a grape; the second
much resembles the Burgundy grape, and
if exposed to the sun a good wine might
be made from them. The third sort resembles
Zant currants, which are so frequently
used in cakes, &amp;c. in England,
and if proper care was taken of them,
would be equal, if not superior, to those
of that country.</p>

<p class='c000'>The MULBERRY TREE is of two
kinds, red and white, and nearly of the
same size of those of France and Italy,
and grow in such plenty, as to feed any
quantity of silk worms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CRAB APPLE TREE bears a
fruit that is much larger and better flavoured
than those of Europe.</p>

<p class='c000'>The PLUM TREE. There are two
sorts of plums in this country, one a
large sort of a purple cast on one side, and
red on the reverse, the second totally
green, and much smaller. Both these are
of a good flavour, and are greatly esteemed
by the Indians, whose taste is
not refined, but who are satisfied with the
<span class='pageno' title='504' id='Page_504'></span>productions of nature in their unimproved
state.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CHERRY TREE. There are
three sorts of cherries in this country; the
black, the red, and the sand cherry; the
two latter may with more propriety be
ranked among the shrubs, as the bush
that bears the sand cherries almost creeps
along the ground, and the other rises not
above eight or ten feet in height; however
I shall give an account of them all in
this place. The black cherries are about
the size of a currant, and hang in clusters
like grapes; the trees which bear them
being very fruitful, they are generally
loaded, but the fruit is not good to eat,
however they give an agreeable flavour to
brandy, and turn it to the colour of claret.
The red cherries grow in the
greatest profusion, and hang in bunches
like the black sort just described; so that
the bushes which bear them appear at a
distance like solid bodies of red matter.
Some people admire this fruit, but they
partake of the nature and taste of alum,
leaving a disagreeable roughness in the
throat, and being very astringent. As I
have already described the sand cherries,
<span class='pageno' title='505' id='Page_505'></span>which greatly exceed the two other sorts
both in flavour and size, I shall give no
further description of them. The wood
of the black cherry-tree is very useful,
and works well into cabinet ware.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SWEET GUM TREE or LIQUID
AMBER (Copalm) is not only
extremely common, but it affords a balm,
the virtues of which are infinite. Its bark
is black and hard, and its wood so tender
and supple, that when the tree is felled,
you may draw from the middle of it
rods of five or six feet in length. It cannot
be employed in building or furniture,
as it warps continually. Its leaf is indented
with five points like a star. This
balm is reckoned by the Indians to be an
excellent febrifuge, and it cures wounds
in two or three days.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>SHRUBS.</h3>

<p class='c016'>The Willow, Shin Wood, Shumack,
Sassafras, the Prickly Ash, Moose Wood,
Spoon Wood, Large Elder, Dwarf Elder,
Poisonous Elder, Juniper, Shrub Oak,
Sweet Fern, the Laurel, the Witch Hazle,
<span class='pageno' title='506' id='Page_506'></span>the Myrtle Wax Tree, Winter
Green, the Fever Bush, the Cranberry
Bush, the Goosberry Bush, the Currant
Bush, the Whirtle Berry, the Rasberry,
the Black Berry, and the Choak Berry.</p>

<p class='c009'>The WILLOW. There are several
species of the willow, the most remarkable
of which is a small sort that grows on
the banks of the Mississippi, and some
other places adjacent. The bark of this
shrub supplies the beaver with its winter
food; and where the water has washed
the soil from its roots, they appear to
consist of fibres interwoven together like
thread, the colour of which is of an inexpressibly
fine scarlet; with this the Indians
tinge many of the ornamental parts
of their dress.</p>

<p class='c000'>SHIN WOOD. This extraordinary
shrub grows in the forests, and rising like
a vine, runs near the ground for six or
eight feet, and then takes root again; in
the same manner taking root, and springing
up successively, one stalk covers a large
space; this proves very troublesome to
the hasty traveller, by striking against
<span class='pageno' title='507' id='Page_507'></span>his shins, and entangling his legs; from
which it has acquired its name.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SASSAFRAS is a wood well
<a id='known'></a>known for its medicinal qualities. It
might with equal propriety be termed a
tree as a shrub, as it sometimes grows
thirty feet high; but in general it does
not reach higher than those of the shrub
kind. The leaves, which yield an agreeable
fragrance, are large, and nearly separated
into three divisions. It bears a reddish
brown berry of the size and shape of
Pimento, and which is sometimes used in
the colonies as a substitute for that spice.
The bark or roots of this tree is infinitely
superior to the wood for its use in medicine,
and I am surprized it is so seldom
to be met with, as its efficacy is so much
greater.</p>

<p class='c000'>The PRICKLY ASH is a shrub that
sometimes grows to the height of ten or
fifteen feet, and has a leaf exactly resembling
that of an ash, but it receives the
epithet to its name from the abundance
of short thorns with which every branch
is covered, and which renders it very
troublesome to those who pass through the
spot where they grow thick. It also bears
<span class='pageno' title='508' id='Page_508'></span>a scarlet berry, which when ripe, has a
fiery taste like pepper. The bark of this
tree, particularly the bark of the roots,
is highly esteemed by the natives for its
medicinal qualities. I have already mentioned
one instance of its efficacy, and
there is no doubt but that the decoction of
it will expeditiously and radically remove
all impurities of the blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The MOOSE WOOD grows about
four feet high, and is very full of branches;
but what renders it worth notice is its
bark, which is of so strong and pliable
a texture, that being peeled off at any
season, and twisted, makes equally as
good cordage as hemp.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SPOON WOOD is a species of
the laurel, and the wood when sawed resembles
box wood.</p>

<p class='c000'>The ELDER, commonly termed the
poisonous elder, nearly resembles the other
sorts in its leaves and branches, but it
grows much straiter, and is only found
in swamps and moist soils. This shrub
is endowed with a very extraordinary
quality, that renders it poisonous to some
constitutions, which it effects if the person
only approaches within a few yards
<span class='pageno' title='509' id='Page_509'></span>of it, whilst others may even chew
the leaves or the rind without receiving
the least detriment from them: the poison
however is not mortal, though it operates
very violently on the infected person,
whose body and head swell to an amazing
size, and are covered with eruptions, that
at their height resemble the confluent
small-pox. As it grows also in many of
the provinces, the inhabitants cure its
venom by drinking saffron tea, and anointing
the external parts with a mixture composed
of cream and marsh mallows.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SHRUB OAK is exactly similar
to the oak tree, both in its wood and
leaves, and like that it bears an acorn, but
it never rises from the ground above four or
five feet, growing crooked and knotty. It
is found chiefly on a dry gravelly soil.</p>

<p class='c000'>The WITCH HAZLE grows very
bushy, about ten feet high, and is covered
early in May with numerous white blossoms.
When this shrub is in bloom, the
Indians esteem it a further indication that
the frost is entirely gone, and that they
might sow their corn. It has been said,
that it is possessed of the power of attracting
gold or silver, and that twigs of it are made
<span class='pageno' title='510' id='Page_510'></span>use of to discover where the veins of these
metals lie hid; but I am apprehensive that
this is only a fallacious story, and not to
be depended on; however that supposition
has given it the name of Witch Hazle.</p>

<p class='c000'>The MYRTLE WAX TREE is a
shrub about four or five feet high, the
leaves of which are larger than those of
the common myrtle, but they smell exactly
alike. It bears its fruit in bunches
like a nosegay, rising from the same place
in various stalks about two inches long:
at the end of each of these is a little nut
containing a kernel, which is wholly covered
with a gluey substance, which being
boiled in water, swims on the surface of it,
and becomes a kind of green wax; this is
more valuable than bees-wax, being of a
more brittle nature, but mixed with it
makes a good candle, which as it burns
sends forth an agreeable scent.</p>

<p class='c000'>WINTER GREEN. This is an
ever-green of the species of the myrtle,
and is found on dry heaths; the flowers
of it are white, and in the form of a rose,
but not larger than a silver penny; in
the winter it is full of red berries about
the size of a sloe, which are smooth and
<span class='pageno' title='511' id='Page_511'></span>round; these are preserved during the
severe season by the snow, and are at that
time in the highest perfection. The Indians
eat these berries, esteeming them
very balsamic, and invigorating to the
stomach. The people inhabiting the interior
colonies steep both the sprigs and berries in
beer, and use it as a diet drink for cleansing
the blood from scorbutic disorders.</p>

<p class='c000'>The FEVER BUSH grows about five
or six feet high; its leaf is like that of a
lilach, and it bears a reddish berry of a
spicy flavour. The stalks of it are excessively
brittle. A decoction of the buds
or wood is an excellent febrifuge, and
from this valuable property it receives its
name. It is an ancient Indian remedy
for all inflammatory complaints, and likewise
much esteemed on the same account
by the inhabitants of the interior parts of
the colonies.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CRANBERRY BUSH. Though
the fruit of this bush greatly resembles
in size and appearance that of the common
sort, which grows on a small vine in
morasses and bogs, yet the bush runs to
the height of ten or twelve feet; but it is
very rarely to be met with. As the
<span class='pageno' title='512' id='Page_512'></span>meadow cranberry, being of a local growth,
and flourishing only in morasses, cannot
be transplanted or cultivated, the former,
if removed at a proper season, would be
a valuable acquisition to the garden, and
with proper nurture prove equally as good,
if not better.</p>

<p class='c000'>The CHOAK BERRY. The shrub
thus termed by the natives grows about
five or six feet high, and bears a berry
about the size of a sloe, of a jet black,
which contains several small seeds within
the pulp. The juice of this fruit, though
not of a disagreeable flavour, is extremely
tart, and leaves a roughness in the mouth
and throat when eaten, that has gained it
the name of choak berry.</p>

<h3 class='c014'>ROOTS and PLANTS.</h3>

<p class='c016'>Elecampane, Spikenard, Angelica, Sarsaparilla,
Ginsang, Ground Nuts, Wild
Potatoes, Liquorice, Snake Root, Gold
Thread, Solomon’s Seal, Devil’s Bit,

Mandrakes, Hellebore White and
Black.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='513' id='Page_513'></span>SPIKENARD, vulgarly called in the
colonies Petty-Morrell. This plant appears
to be exactly the same as the Asiatick
spikenard, so much valued by the ancients.
It grows near the sides of brooks
in rocky places, and its stem, which is
about the size of a goose quill, springs up
like that of angelica, reaching about a foot
and an half from the ground. It bears
bunches of berries in all respects like those
of the elder, only rather larger. These
are of such a balsamic nature, that when
infused in spirits, they make a most palatable
and reviving cordial.</p>

<p class='c000'>SARSAPARILLA. The root of this
plant, which is the most estimable part of
it, is about the size of a goose quill, and
runs in different directions, twined and
crooked to a great length in the ground;
from the principal stem of it springs many
smaller fibres, all of which are tough and
flexible. From the root immediately
shoots a stalk about a foot and an half long,
which at the top branches into three
stems; each of these has three leaves,
much of the shape and size of a walnut
leaf; and from the fork of each of the
three stems grows a bunch of bluish white
<span class='pageno' title='514' id='Page_514'></span>flowers, resembling those of the spikenard.
The bark of the roots, which alone should
be used in medicine, is of a bitterish flavour,
but aromatic. It is deservedly esteemed
for its medicinal virtues, being a gentle
sudorific, and very powerful in attenuating
the blood when impeded by gross humours.</p>

<p class='c000'>GINSANG is a root that was once
supposed to grow only in Korea, from
whence it was usually exported to Japan,
and by that means found its way to Europe;
but it has been lately discovered to
be also a native of North America, where
it grows to as great perfection and is
equally valuable. Its root is like a small
carrot, but not so taper at the end; it
is sometimes divided into two or more
branches, in all other respects it resembles
sarsaparilla in its growth. The taste
of the root is bitterish. In the eastern
parts of Asia it bears a great price, being
there considered as a panacea, and is the
last refuge of the inhabitants in all disorders.
When chewed it certainly is a great
strengthener of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c000'>GOLD THREAD. This is a plant
of the small vine kind, which grows in
<span class='pageno' title='515' id='Page_515'></span>swampy places, and lies on the ground.
The roots spread themselves just under the
surface of the morass, and are easily drawn
up by handfuls. They resemble a large
entangled skain of thread of a fine bright
gold colour; and I am persuaded would
yield a beautiful and permanent yellow
dye. It is also greatly esteemed both by
the Indians and colonists as a remedy for
any soreness in the mouth, but the taste
of it is exquisitely bitter.</p>

<p class='c000'>SOLOMON’s SEAL is a plant that
grows on the sides of rivers, and in rich
meadow land. It rises in the whole to
about three feet high, the stalks being two
feet, when the leaves begin to spread
themselves and reach a foot further. A
part in every root has an impression upon
it about the size of a sixpence, which appears
as if it was made by a seal, and
from these it receives its name. It is greatly
valued on account of its being a fine
purifier of the blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>DEVIL’s BIT is another wild plant,
which grows in the fields, and receives
its name from a print that seems to be
made by teeth in the roots. The Indians
say that this was once an universal remedy
<span class='pageno' title='516' id='Page_516'></span>for every disorder that human nature is incident
to; but some of the evil spirits envying
mankind the possession of so efficacious
a medicine gave the root a bite, which
deprived it of a great part of its virtue.</p>

<p class='c000'>BLOOD ROOT. A sort of plantain
that springs out of the ground in six or
seven long rough leaves, the veins of which
are red; the root of it is like a small carrot
both in colour and appearance; when
broken, the inside of it is of a deeper color
than the outside, and distils several
drops of juice that look like blood. This
is a strong emetic, but a very dangerous
one.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' title='517' id='Page_517'></span>SANICLE has a root which is thick
towards the upper part, and full of small
fibres below; the leaves of it are broad,
roundish, hard, smooth, and of a fine
shining green; a stalk rises from these
to the height of a foot, which is quite
smooth and free from knots, and on the
top of it are several small flowers of a reddish
white, shaped like a wild rose. A
tea made of the root is vulnerary and balsamic.</p>

<p class='c000'>RATTLE SNAKE PLANTAIN.
This useful herb is of the plantain kind,
and its leaves, which spread themselves
on the ground, are about one inch and
an half wide, and five inches long; from
the centre of these arises a small stalk
nearly six inches long, which bears a little
white flower; the root is about the size of
a goose quill, and much bent and divided
into several branches. The leaves of this
herb are more efficacious than any other
part of it for the bite of the reptile from
which it receives its name; and being
chewed and applied immediately to the
wound, and some of the juice swallowed,
<a id='seldom'></a>seldom fails of averting every dangerous
symptom. So convinced are the Indians
<span class='pageno' title='518' id='Page_518'></span>of the power of this infallible antidote,
that for a trifling bribe of spirituous liquor,
they will at any time permit a rattle
snake to drive his fangs into their flesh. It
is to be remarked that during those months
in which the bite of these creatures is most
venomous, that this remedy for it is in its
greatest perfection, and most luxuriant in
its growth.</p>

<p class='c000'>POOR ROBIN’s PLANTAIN is of
the same species as the last, but more diminutive
in every respect; it receives its
name from its size, and the poor land on
which it grows. It is a good medicinal
herb, and often administered with success
in fevers and internal weaknesses.</p>

<p class='c000'>TOAD PLANTAIN resembles the
common plantain, only it grows much
ranker, and is thus denominated because
toads love to harbour under it.</p>

<p class='c000'>ROCK LIVERWORT is a sort of liverwort
that grows on rocks, and is of the
nature of kelp or moss. It is esteemed as
an excellent remedy against declines.</p>

<p class='c000'>GARGIT or SKOKE is a large kind
of weed, the leaves of which are about
six inches long, and two inches and an half
broad; they resemble those of spinage in
<span class='pageno' title='519' id='Page_519'></span>their colour and texture, but not in shape.
The root is very large, from which spring
different stalks that run eight or ten feet
high, and are full of red berries; these
hang in clusters in the month of September,
and are generally called pigeon berries,
as those birds then feed on them.
When the leaves first spring from the
ground, after being boiled, they are a
nutritious and wholesome vegetable, but
when they are grown nearly to their full
size, they acquire a poisonous quality. The
roots applied to the hands or feet of a person
afflicted with a fever, prove a very
powerful absorbent.</p>

<p class='c000'>SKUNK CABBAGE or POKE is an
herb that grows in moist and swampy
places. The leaves of it are about a foot
long, and six inches broad, nearly oval, but
rather pointed. The roots are composed
of great numbers of fibres, a lotion of
which is made use of by the people in
the colonies for the cure of the itch. There
issues a strong musky smell from this
herb, something like the animal of the
same name before described, and on that
account it is so termed.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' title='520' id='Page_520'></span>WAKE ROBIN is an herb that grows
in swampy lands; its root resembles a
small turnip, and if tasted will greatly inflame
the tongue, and immediately convert
it from its natural shape into a round
hard substance; in which state it will continue
for some time, and during this no
other part of the mouth will be affected.
But when dried, it loses its astringent
quality, and becomes beneficial to mankind,
for if grated into cold water, and
taken internally, it is very good for all
complaints of the bowels.</p>

<p class='c000'>WILD INDIGO is an herb of the
same species as that from whence indigo is
made in the southern colonies. It grows
in one stalk to the height of five or six
inches from the ground, when it divides
into many branches, from which issue a
great number of small hard bluish leaves
that spread to a great breadth, and among
these it bears a yellow flower; the juice
of it has a very disagreeable scent.</p>

<p class='c000'>CAT MINT has a woody root, divided
into several branches, and it sends
forth a stalk about three feet high; the
leaves are like those of the nettle or betony,
and they have a strong smell of
<span class='pageno' title='521' id='Page_521'></span>mint, with a biting acrid taste; the flowers
grow on the tops of the branches, and
are of a faint purple or whitish colour. It
is called cat mint, because it is said that
cats have an antipathy to it, and will not
let it grow. It has nearly the virtues of
common mint<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c017'><sup>[1]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c009'>I shall not enter into a minute description

<p class='c016'>Maize or Indian Corn, Wild Rice,
Beans, the Squash, &amp;c.</p>
<p class='c009'>MAIZE or INDIAN CORN grows
from six to ten feet high, on a stalk full
of joints, which is stiff and solid, and
when green, abounding with a sweet juice.
The leaves are like those of the reed, about
two feet in length, and three or four
inches broad. The flowers, which are
produced at some distance from the fruit
on the same plant, grow like the ears of
oats, and are sometimes white, yellow, or
of a purple colour. The seeds are as large
as peas, and like them quite naked and
smooth, but of a roundish surface, rather
compressed. One spike generally consists
of about six hundred grains, which are
placed closely together in rows to the number
of eight or ten, and sometimes twelve.
This corn is very wholesome, easy of digestion,
and yields as good nourishment as
any other sort. After the Indians have
<span class='pageno' title='523' id='Page_523'></span>reduced it into meal by pounding it, they
make cakes of it and bake them before
the fire. I have already mentioned that
some nations eat it in cakes before it is
ripe, in which state it is very agreeable to
the palate and extremely nutritive.</p>

<p>The <span class='sc'>Tobacco Plant</span><br /><br /><i>Published Nov. 1<sup>st</sup>. 1779</i></p>

</div>

<p class='c000'>WILD RICE. This grain, which
grows in the greatest plenty throughout
the interior parts of North America, is
the most valuable of all the spontaneous
productions of that country. Exclusive
of its utility, as a supply of food for those
of the human species who inhabit this
part of the continent, and obtained without
any other trouble than that of gathering
it in, the sweetness and nutritious
quality of it attracts an infinite number of
wild fowl of every kind, which flock
from distant climes to enjoy this rare repast;
and by it become inexpressibly fat
and delicious. In future periods it will
be of great service to the infant colonies,
as it will afford them a present support,
until in the course of cultivation other supplies
may be produced; whereas in those
realms which are not furnished with this
bounteous gift of nature, even if the climate
is temperate and the soil good, the
<span class='pageno' title='524' id='Page_524'></span>first settlers are often exposed to great hardships
from the want of an immediate resource
for necessary food. This useful
grain grows in the water where it is about
two feet deep, and where it finds a rich
muddy soil. The stalks of it, and the
branches or ears that bear the seed, resemble
oats both in their appearance and
manner of growing. The stalks are full
of joints, and rise more than eight feet
above the water. The natives gather the
grain in the following manner: nearly
about the time that it begins to turn from
its milky state and to ripen, they run
their canoes into the midst of it, and
tying bunches of it together just below
the ears with bark, leave it in this situation
three or four weeks longer, till it is
perfectly ripe. About the latter end of
September they return to the river, when
each family having its separate allotment,
and being able to distinguish their own
property by the manner of fastening the
sheaves, gather in the portion that belongs
to them. This they do by placing their
canoes close to the bunches of rice, in
such position as to receive the grain when
it falls, and then beat it out, with pieces
<span class='pageno' title='525' id='Page_525'></span>of wood formed for that purpose. Having
done this, they dry it with smoke, and
afterwards tread or rub off the outside
husk; when it is fit for use they put it
into the skins of fawns or young buffalos
taken off nearly whole for this purpose
and sewed into a sort of sack, wherein they
preserve it till the return of their harvest.
It has been the subject of much speculation
why this spontaneous grain is not
found in any other regions of America, or
in those countries situated in the same parallels
of latitude, where the waters are as
apparently adapted for its growth as in
the climates I treat of. As for instance,
none of the countries that lie to the south
and east of the great lakes, even from the
provinces north of the Carolinas to the
extremities of Labradore, produce any of
this grain. It is true I found great quantities
of it in the watered lands near Detroit,
between Lake Huron and Lake
Erié, but on enquiry I learned that it never
arrived nearer to maturity than just to
blossom; after which it appeared blighted,
and died away. This convinces me that
the north-west wind, as I have before hinted,
is much more powerful in these than
<span class='pageno' title='526' id='Page_526'></span>in the interior parts; and that it is more
inimical to the fruits of the earth, after
it has passed over the lakes and become
united with the wind which joins it from
the frozen regions of the north, than it is
farther to the westward.</p>

<p class='c000'>BEANS. These are nearly of the same
shape as the European beans, but are not
much larger than the smallest size of them.
They are boiled by the Indians and eaten
chiefly with bear’s flesh.</p>

<p class='c000'>The SQUASH. They have also several
species of the MELON or PUMPKIN,
which by some are called Squashes, and
which serve many nations partly as a substitute
for bread. Of these there is the
round, the crane-neck, the small flat, and
the large oblong squash. The smaller
sorts being boiled, are eaten during the
summer as vegetables; and are all of a
pleasing flavour. The crane-neck, which
greatly excells all the others, are usually
hung up for a winter’s store, and in this
manner might be preserved for several
months.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_2_0_7 c006'>THE countries that lie between the
great lakes and River Mississippi,
and from thence southward to West Florida,
although in the midst of a large
continent, and at a great distance from the
sea, are so situated, that a communication
between them and other realms might
conveniently be opened; by which means
those empires or colonies that may hereafter
be founded or planted therein, will be rendered
commercial ones. The great River
Mississippi, which runs through the whole
of them, will enable their inhabitants to
establish an intercourse with foreign climes,
equally as well as the Euphrates, the Nile,
the Danube, or the Wolga do those people
which dwell on their banks, and who
have no other convenience for exporting
the produce of their own country, or for
importing those of others, than boats and
vessels of light burden: notwithstanding
<span class='pageno' title='528' id='Page_528'></span>which they have become powerful and
opulent states.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Mississippi, as I have before observed,
runs from north to south, and
passes through the most fertile and temperate
part of North America, excluding
only the extremities of it, which verge both
on the torrid and frigid zones. Thus favourably
situated, when once its banks
are covered with inhabitants, they need
not long be at a loss for means to establish
an extensive and profitable commerce.
They will find the country towards
the south almost spontaneously producing
silk, cotton, indico, and tobacco;
and the more northern parts, wine, oil,
beef, tallow, skins, buffalo-wool, and
furs; with lead, copper, iron, coals, lumber,
corn, rice, and fruits, besides earth
and barks for dying.</p>

<p class='c000'>These articles, with which it abounds
even to profusion, may be transported
to the ocean through this river without
greater difficulty than that which attends
the conveyance of merchandize down
some of those I have just mentioned. It is
true that the Mississippi being the boundary
between the English and Spanish settlements,
<span class='pageno' title='529' id='Page_529'></span>and the Spaniards in possession
of the mouth of it, they may obstruct the
passage of it, and greatly dishearten those
who make the first attempts; yet when
the advantages that will certainly arise to
settlers are known, multitudes of adventurers,
allured by the prospect of such
abundant riches, will flock to it, and establish
themselves, though at the expence of
rivers of blood.</p>

<p class='c000'>But should the nation that happens to
be in possession of New Orleans prove
unfriendly to the internal settlers, they
may find a way into the Gulph of Mexico
by the River Iberville, which empties
itself from the Mississippi, after passing
through Lake Maurepas, into Lake Ponchartrain;
which has a communication
with the sea within the borders of West
Florida. The River Iberville branches off
from the Mississippi about eighty miles
above New Orleans, and though it is at
present choaked up in some parts, it might
at an inconsiderable expence be made navigable
so as to answer all the purposes
proposed.</p>

<p class='c000'>Although the English have acquired
since the last peace a more extensive knowledge
<span class='pageno' title='530' id='Page_530'></span>of the interior parts than were ever
obtained before, even by the French, yet
many of their productions still remain
unknown. And though I was not deficient
either in assiduity or attention during
the short time I remained in them, yet
I must acknowledge that the intelligence
I gained was not so perfect as I could
wish, and that it requires further researches
to make the world thoroughly acquainted
with the real value of these long hidden
realms.</p>

<p class='c000'>The parts of the Mississippi of which
no survey have hitherto been taken, amount
to upwards of eight hundred miles, following
the course of the stream, that is,
from the Illinois to the Ouisconsin Rivers.
Those which lie to the north of the latter
are included in the map of my travels.
Plans of such as reach from the former
to the Gulph of Mexico, have been delineated
by several hands; one of the
best of these, according to its size, now
extant, in which is included the whole
continent of North America, is annexed
to this work. And I have the pleasure to
find that an actual survey of the intermediate
parts of the Mississippi, between the
<span class='pageno' title='531' id='Page_531'></span>Illinois River and the sea, with the Ohio,
Cherokee, and Ouabache Rivers, taken
on the spot by a very ingenious Gentleman<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c017'><sup>[2]</sup></a>,
is now published. I flatter myself
that the observations therein contained,
which have been made by one whose
knowledge of the parts therein described
was acquired by a personal investigation,
aided by a solid judgment, will confirm
the remarks I have made, and promote the
plan I am here recommending.</p>

<p class='c000'>In the map of North America adjoined,
I have partitioned the country which
lies adjacent to the eastern borders of
the Mississippi into plantations or subordinate
colonies; chusing such lands only
for this purpose as by being contiguous to
some river, might enjoy all the advantages
I have before pointed out. These
I have divided by dotted lines, and numbered;
that future adventurers may readily,
by referring to the map, chuse a
commodious and advantageous situation. I
shall also here give a concise description of
<span class='pageno' title='532' id='Page_532'></span>each, beginning, according to the rule of
geographers, with that which lies most to
the north.</p>

<p class='c000'>It is however necessary to observe, that
before these settlements can be established,
grants must be procured in the manner
customary on such occasions, and the
lands be purchased of those who have acquired
a right to them by a long possession:
but no greater difficulty will attend
the completion of this point, than
the original founders of every colony on
the continent met with to obstruct their
intentions; and the number of Indians
who inhabit these tracts being greatly inadequate
to their extent, it is not to be
doubted, but they will readily give up
for a reasonable consideration, territories
that are of little use to them; or remove
for the accommodation of their new neighbours
to lands at a greater distance from
the Mississippi, the navigation of which is
not essential to the welfare of their communities.</p>

<p class='c000'>N<sup>o</sup> I. The country within these lines,
from its situation, is colder than any of
the others; yet I am convinced that the
<span class='pageno' title='533' id='Page_533'></span>air is much more temperate than in
those provinces that lie in the same degree
of latitude to the east of it. The
soil is excellent, and there is a great
deal of land that is free from woods in
the parts adjoining to the Mississippi;
whilst on the contrary the north-eastern
borders of it are well wooded. Towards
the heads of the River Saint Croix, rice
grows in great plenty, and there is abundance
of copper. Though the Falls of
Saint Anthony are situated at the south-east
corner of this division, yet that impediment
will not totally obstruct the
navigation, as the River Saint Croix,
which runs through a great part of the
southern side of it, enters the Mississippi
just below the Falls, and flows with so
gentle a current that it affords a convenient
navigation for boats. This tract
is about one hundred miles from north-west
to south-east, and one hundred and
twenty miles from north-east to south-west.</p>

<p class='c000'>N<sup>o</sup> II. This tract, as I have already
described it in my Journals, exceeds the
highest encomiums I can give it; notwithstanding
which it is entirely uninhabited,
<span class='pageno' title='534' id='Page_534'></span>and the profusion of blessings
that nature has showered on this heavenly
spot return unenjoyed to the lap from
whence they sprung. Lake Pepin, as I
have termed it after the French, lies
within these bounds; but the lake to
which that name properly belongs is a
little above in the River St. Croix; however,
as all the traders call the lower
lake by that name, I have so denominated
it, contrary to the information I
received from the Indians. This colony
lying in unequal angles, the dimensions
of it cannot be exactly given, but it appears
to be on an average about one hundred
and ten miles long, and eighty
broad.</p>

<p class='c000'>N<sup>o</sup> III. The greatest part of this division
is situated on the River Ouisconsin,
which is navigable for boats about one
hundred and eighty miles, till it reaches
the Carrying-place that divides it from
the Fox River. The land which is contained
within its limits, is in some parts
mountainous, and in others consists of
fertile meadows and fine pasturage. It
is furnished also with a great deal of good
timber, and, as is generally the case on the
<span class='pageno' title='535' id='Page_535'></span>banks of the Mississippi and its branches,
has much fine, open, clear land, proper
for cultivation. To these are added an
inexhaustible fund of riches, in a number
of lead mines which lie at a little distance
from the Ouisconsin towards the south,
and appear to be uncommonly full of
ore. Although the Saukies and Ottagaumies
inhabit a part of this tract, the whole
of the lands under their cultivation does
not exceed three hundred acres. It is in
length from east to west about one hundred
and fifty miles, and about eighty
from north to south.</p>

<p class='c000'>N<sup>o</sup> IV. The colony here marked out
consists of lands of various denominations,
some of which are very good, and
others very bad. The best is situated on
the borders of the Green Bay and the
Fox River, where there are innumerable
acres covered with fine grass, most part
of which grows to an astonishing height.
This river will afford a good navigation
for boats throughout the whole of its
course, which is about one hundred and
eighty miles, except between the Winnebago
Lake, and the Green Bay; where
there are several Carrying-places in the
<span class='pageno' title='536' id='Page_536'></span>space of thirty miles. The Fox River is
rendered remarkable by the abundance of
rice that grows on its shores, and the almost
infinite numbers of wild fowl that
frequent its banks. The land which lies
near it appears to be very fertile, and promises
to produce a sufficient supply of all
the necessaries of life for any number of
inhabitants. A communication might be
opened by those who shall settle here, either
through the Green Bay, Lake Michigan,
Lake Huron, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario
with Canada, or by way of the Ouisconsin
into the Mississippi. This division is
about one hundred and sixty miles long
from north to south, and one hundred
and forty broad.</p>

<p class='c000'>N<sup>o</sup> V. This is an excellent tract of
land, and, considering its interior situation,
has greater advantages than could be
expected; for having the Mississippi on its
western borders, and the Illinois on its
south-east, it has as free a navigation as
most of the others. The northern parts
of it <a id='are'></a>are somewhat mountainous, but it
contains a great deal of clear land, the
soil of which is excellent, with many fine
fertile meadows, and not a few rich mines.
<span class='pageno' title='537' id='Page_537'></span>It is upwards of two hundred miles from
north to south, and one hundred and
fifty from east to west.</p>

<p class='c000'>N<sup>o</sup> VI. This colony being situated
upon the heads of the Rivers Illinois and
Ouabache, the former of which empties
itself immediately into the Mississippi,
and the latter into the same river by
means of the Ohio, will readily find a
communication with the sea through
these. Having also the River Miamis
passing though it, which runs into Lake
Erie, an intercourse might be established
with Canada also by way of the lakes, as
before pointed out. It contains a great
deal of rich fertile land, and though more
inland than any of the others, will be as
valuable an acquisition as the best of them.
From north to south it is about one hundred
and sixty miles, from east to west
one hundred and eighty.</p>

<p class='c000'>N<sup>o</sup> VII. This division is not inferior
to any of the foregoing. Its northern
borders lying adjacent to the Illinois river,
and its western to the Mississippi, the
situation of it for establishing a commercial
intercourse with foreign nations is
very commodious. It abounds with all
<span class='pageno' title='538' id='Page_538'></span>the necessaries of life, and is about one
hundred and fifty miles from north to
south, and sixty miles from east to west;
but the confines of it being more irregular
than the others, I cannot exactly ascertain
the dimensions of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>N<sup>o</sup> VIII. This colony having the River
Ouabache running through the centre of
it, and the Ohio for its southern boundary,
will enjoy the advantages of a free
navigation. It extends about one hundred
and forty miles from north to south, and
one hundred and thirty from east to west.</p>

<p class='c000'>N<sup>o</sup> IX. X. and XI. being similar in
situation, and furnished with nearly the
same conveniencies as all the others, I
shall only give their dimensions. N<sup>o</sup> IX.
is about eighty miles each way, but not
exactly square. N<sup>o</sup> X. is nearly in the
same form, and about the same extent.
N<sup>o</sup> XI. is much larger, being at least one
hundred and fifty miles from north to
south, and one hundred and forty from
east to west, as nearly as from its irregularity
it is possible to calculate.</p>

<p class='c000'>After the description of this delightful
country I have already given, I need not
repeat that all the spots I have thus
<span class='pageno' title='539' id='Page_539'></span>pointed out as proper for colonization,
abound not only with the necessaries of
life, being well stored with rice, deer,
buffalos, bears, &amp;c. but produce in equal
abundance such as may be termed luxuries,
or at least those articles of commerce
before recited, which the inhabitants of it
will have an opportunity of exchanging for
the needful productions of other countries.</p>

<p class='c000'>The discovery of a north-west passage
to India has been the subject of innumerable
disquisitions. Many efforts likewise
have been made by way of Hudson’s
Bay to penetrate into the Pacific Ocean,
though without success. I shall not
therefore trouble myself to enumerate the
advantages that would result from this
much wished-for discovery, its utility being
already too well known to the commercial
world to need any elucidation; I shall
only confine myself to the methods that
appear most probable to ensure success to
future adventurers.</p>

<p class='c000'>The many attempts that have hitherto
been made for this purpose, but
which have all been rendered abortive,
seem to have turned the spirit of making
useful researches into another channel,
<span class='pageno' title='540' id='Page_540'></span>and this most interesting one has almost
been given up as impracticable; but, in my
opinion, their failure rather proceeds from
their being begun at an improper place,
than from their impracticability.</p>

<p class='c000'>All navigators that have hitherto gone
in search of this passage, have first entered
Hudson’s Bay; the consequence
of which has been, that having spent the
season during which only those seas are
navigable, in exploring many of the numerous
inlets lying therein, and this without
discovering any opening, terrified at
the approach of winter, they have hastened
back for fear of being frozen up, and consequently
of being obliged to continue till
the return of summer in those bleak and
dreary realms. Even such as have perceived
the coasts to enfold themselves,
and who have of course entertained hopes
of succeeding, have been deterred from
prosecuting their voyage, lest the winter
should set in before they could reach a
more temperate climate.</p>

<p class='c000'>These apprehensions have discouraged
the boldest adventurers from completing the
expeditions in which they have engaged,
and frustrated every attempt. But as it has
<span class='pageno' title='541' id='Page_541'></span>been discovered by such as have sailed into
the northern parts of the Pacific Ocean,
that there are many inlets which verge
towards Hudson’s Bay, it is not to be
doubted but that a passage might be made
out from that quarter, if it be sought for
at a proper season. And should these expectations
be disappointed, the explorers
would not be in the same hazardous situation
with those who set out from Hudson’s
Bay, for they will always be sure
of a safe retreat, through an open sea, to
warmer regions, even after repeated disappointments.
And this confidence will
enable them to proceed with greater resolution,
and probably be the means of
effecting what too much circumspection
or timidity has prevented.</p>

<p class='c000'>These reasons for altering the plan of enquiry
after this convenient passage, carry
with them such conviction, that in the
year 1774 Richard Whitworth, Esq. member
of parliament for Stafford, a gentleman
of an extensive knowledge in geography, of
an active enterprising disposition, and whose
benevolent mind is ever ready to promote
the happiness of individuals, or the welfare
of the public, from the representations
<span class='pageno' title='542' id='Page_542'></span>made to him of the expediency of it by
myself and others, intended to travel across
the continent of America, that he might
attempt to carry a scheme of this kind
into execution.</p>

<p class='c000'>He designed to have pursued nearly the
same route that I did; and after having
built a fort at Lake Pepin, to have proceeded
up the River St. Pierre, and from
thence up a branch of the River Messorie,
till having discovered the source of the
Oregan or River of the West, on the
other side the summit of the lands that divide
the waters which run into the Gulph
of Mexico from those that fall into the
Pacific Ocean, he would have sailed down
that river to the place where it is said
to empty itself near the Straights of Annian.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having there established another settlement
on some spot that appeared
best calculated for the support of his
people, in the neighbourhood of some
of the inlets which tend towards the
north-east, he would from thence have
begun his researches. This gentleman
was to have been attended in the expedition
by Colonel Rogers, myself, and
<span class='pageno' title='543' id='Page_543'></span>others, and to have taken out with him
a sufficient number of artificers and mariners
for building the forts and vessels necessary
on the occasion, and for navigating
the latter; in all not less than fifty or
sixty men. The grants and other requisites
for this purpose were even nearly
completed, when the present troubles in
America began, which put a stop to an
enterprize that promised to be of inconceivable
advantage to the British dominions.</p>

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
